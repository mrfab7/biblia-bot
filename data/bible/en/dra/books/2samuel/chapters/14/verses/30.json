{"verse":"30","text":"He said to his servants: You know the field of Joab near my field, that hath a crop of barley: go now and set it on fire. So the servants of Absalom set the corn on fire. And Joabâ€™s servants coming with their garments rent, said: The servants of Absalom have set part of the field on fire."}
