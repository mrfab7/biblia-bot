{"verse":"2","text":"And behold six men came from the way of the upper gate, which looketh to the north: and each one had his weapon of destruction in his hand: and there was one man in the midst of them clothed with linen, with a writerâ€™s inkhorn at his reins: and they went in, and stood by the brazen altar."}
