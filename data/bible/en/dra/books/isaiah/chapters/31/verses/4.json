{"verse":"4","text":"For thus saith the Lord to me: Like as the lion roareth, and the lionâ€™s whelp upon his prey, and when a multitude of shepherds shall come against him, he will not fear at their voice, nor be afraid of their multitude: so shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight upon mount Sion, and upon the hill thereof."}
