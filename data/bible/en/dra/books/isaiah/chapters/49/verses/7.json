{"verse":"7","text":"Thus saith the Lord the redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to the soul that is despised, to the nation that is abhorred, to the servant of rulers: Kings shall see, and princes shall rise up, and adore for the Lordâ€™s sake, because he is faithful, and for the Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee."}
