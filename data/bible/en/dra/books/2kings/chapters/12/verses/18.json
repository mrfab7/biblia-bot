{"verse":"18","text":"Wherefore Joas king of Juda took all the sanctified things, which Josaphat, and Joram, and Ochozias his fathers the kings of Juda had dedicated to holy uses, and which he himself had offered: and all the silver that could be found in the treasures of the temple of the Lord, and in the kingâ€™s palace: and sent it to Hazael king of Syria, and he went off from Jerusalem."}
