{"verse":"3","text":"And it shall come to pass, that when any man shall prophesy any more, his father and his mother that brought him into the world, shall say to him: Thou shalt not live: because thou best spoken a lie in the name of the Lord. And his father, and his mother, his parents, shall thrust him through, when he shall prophesy."}
