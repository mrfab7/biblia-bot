{"verse":"5","text":"A third part of you that come to the sabbath, of the priests, and of the Levites, and of the porters, shall be at the gates: and a third part at the kingâ€™s house: and a third at the gate that is called the Foundation: but let all the rest of the people be in the courts of the house of the Lord."}
