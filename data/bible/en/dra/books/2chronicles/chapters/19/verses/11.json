{"verse":"11","text":"And Amarias the priest your high priest shell be chief in the things which regard God: and Zabadias the son of Ismahel, who is ruler in the house of Juda, shall be over those matters which belong to the kingâ€™s office: and you have before you the Levites for masters, take courage and do diligently, and the Lord will be with you in good things."}
