{"verse":"11","text":"And when it was time to bring the chest before the king by the hands of the Levites, (for they saw there was much money,) the kingâ€™s scribe, and he whom the high priest had appointed went in: and they poured out the money that was in the chest: and they carried back the chest to its place: and thus they did from day to day, and there was gathered an immense sum of money."}
