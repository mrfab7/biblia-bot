{"verse":"15","text":"And the gate of the fountain Sellum the son of Cholhoza built, lord of the street of Maspha: he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks, and the bare, and the walls of the pool of Siloe unto the kingâ€™s guard, and unto the steps that go down from the city of David."}
