{"verse":"95","text":"Then Nabuchodonosor breaking forth, said: Blessed be the God of them, to wit, of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that believed in him: and they changed the kingâ€™s word, and delivered up their bodies that they might not serve, nor adore any god, except their own God."}
