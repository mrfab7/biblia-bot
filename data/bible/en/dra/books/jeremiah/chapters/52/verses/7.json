{"verse":"7","text":"And the city was broken up, and the men of war fled, and went out of the city in the night by the way of the gate that is between the two walls, and leadeth to the kingâ€™s garden, (the Chaldeans besieging the city round about,) sad they went by the way that leadeth to the wilderness."}
