{"verse":"5","text":"And said: If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and my request be not disagreeable to him, I beseech thee, that the former letters of Aman the traitor and enemy of the Jews, by which he commanded that they should be destroyed in all the kingâ€™s provinces, may be reversed by new letters."}
