{"verse":"17","text":"And in all peoples, cities, and provinces, whithersoever the kingâ€™s commandments came, there was wonderful rejoicing, feasts and banquets, and keeping holy day: insomuch that many of other nations and religion, joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies. For a great dread of the name of the Jews had fallen upon all."}
