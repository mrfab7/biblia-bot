{"verse":"14","text":"And she that went in at evening, came out in the morning, and from thence she was conducted to the second house, that was under the hand of Susagaz the eunuch, who had the charge over the kingâ€™s concubines: neither could she return any more to the king, unless the king desired it, and had ordered her by name to come."}
