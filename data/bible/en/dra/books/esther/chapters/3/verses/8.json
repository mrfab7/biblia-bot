{"verse":"8","text":"And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people scattered through all the provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws and ceremonies, and moreover despise the kingâ€™s ordinances: and thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by impunity."}
