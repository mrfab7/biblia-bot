Psalm 1:1\tBlessed is the man who has not followed the counsel of the impious, and has not remained in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the chair of pestilence. Psalm 1:2\tBut his will is with the law of the Lord, and he will meditate on his law, day and night. Psalm 1:3\tAnd he will be like a tree that has been planted beside running waters, which will provide its fruit in its time, and its leaf will not fall away, and all things whatsoever that he does will prosper. Psalm 1:4\tNot so the impious, not so. For they are like the dust that the wind casts along the face of the earth. Psalm 1:5\tTherefore, the impious will not prevail again in judgment, nor sinners in the council of the just. Psalm 1:6\tFor the Lord knows the way of the just. And the path of the impious will pass away. Psalm 2:1\tWhy have the Gentiles been seething, and why have the people been pondering nonsense? Psalm 2:2\tThe kings of the earth have stood up, and the leaders have joined together as one, against the Lord and against his Christ: Psalm 2:3\t“Let us shatter their chains and cast their yoke away from us.” Psalm 2:4\tHe who dwells in heaven will ridicule them, and the Lord will mock them. Psalm 2:5\tThen will he speak to them in his anger and trouble them with his fury. Psalm 2:6\tYet I have been appointed king by him over Zion, his holy mountain, preaching his precepts. Psalm 2:7\tThe Lord has said to me: You are my son, this day have I begotten you. Psalm 2:8\tAsk of me and I will give to you: the Gentiles for your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for your possession. Psalm 2:9\tYou will rule them with an iron rod, and you will shatter them like a potter’s vessel. Psalm 2:10\tAnd now, O kings, understand. Receive instruction, you who judge the earth. Psalm 2:11\tServe the Lord in fear, and exult in him with trembling. Psalm 2:12\tEmbrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord might become angry, and you would perish from the way of the just. Though his wrath can flare up in a short time, blessed are all those who trust in him. Psalm 3:1\tA Psalm of David. When he fled from the face of his son, Absalom. Lord, why have those who trouble me been multiplied? Many rise up against me. Psalm 3:2\tMany say to my soul, “There is no salvation for him in his God.” Psalm 3:3\tBut you, Lord, are my supporter, my glory, and the one who raises up my head. Psalm 3:4\tI have cried out to the Lord with my voice, and he has heard me from his holy mountain. Psalm 3:5\tI have slept, and I have been stupefied. But I awakened because the Lord has taken me up. Psalm 3:6\tI will not fear the thousands of people surrounding me. Rise up, Lord. Save me, my God. Psalm 3:7\tFor you have struck all those who oppose me without cause. You have broken the teeth of sinners. Psalm 3:8\tSalvation is of the Lord, and your blessing is upon your people. Psalm 4:1\tIn parts according to verses. A Psalm of David. When I called upon him, the God of my justice heeded me. In tribulation, you have enlarged me. Have mercy on me, and heed my prayer. Psalm 4:2\tSons of men, how long will you be dull in heart, so that whatever you love is in vain, and whatever you seek is false? Psalm 4:3\tAnd know this: the Lord has made wondrous his holy one. The Lord will heed me when I cry out to him. Psalm 4:4\tBe angry, and do not be willing to sin. The things that you say in your hearts: be sorry for them on your beds. Psalm 4:5\tOffer the sacrifice of justice, and hope in the Lord. Many say, “Who reveals to us what is good?” Psalm 4:6\tThe light of your countenance, Lord, has been sealed upon us. You have given joy to my heart. Psalm 4:7\tBy the fruit of their grain, wine, and oil, they have been multiplied. Psalm 4:8\tIn peace itself, I will sleep and I will rest. For you, O Lord, have established me singularly in hope. Psalm 5:1\tUnto the end. For her who pursues the inheritance. A Psalm of David. O Lord, listen closely to my words. Understand my outcry. Psalm 5:2\tAttend to the voice of my prayer, my King and my God. Psalm 5:3\tFor to you, I will pray. In the morning, Lord, you will hear my voice. Psalm 5:4\tIn the morning, I will stand before you, and I will see. For you are not a God who wills iniquity. Psalm 5:5\tAnd the malicious will not dwell close to you, nor will the unjust endure before your eyes. Psalm 5:6\tYou hate all who work iniquity. You will destroy all who speak a lie. The bloody and deceitful man, the Lord will abominate. Psalm 5:7\tBut I am in the multitude of your mercy. I will enter your house. I will show adoration toward your holy temple, in your fear. Psalm 5:8\tLord, lead me in your justice. Because of my enemies, direct my way in your sight. Psalm 5:9\tFor there is no truth in their mouth: their heart is vain. Psalm 5:10\tTheir throat is an open sepulcher. They have acted deceitfully with their tongues. Judge them, O God. Let them fall by their own intentions: according to the multitude of their impiety, expel them. For they have provoked you, O Lord. Psalm 5:11\tBut let all those who hope in you rejoice. They will exult in eternity, and you will dwell in them. And all those who love your name will glory in you. Psalm 5:12\tFor you will bless the just. You have crowned us, O Lord, as if with a shield of your good will. Psalm 6:1\tIn parts according to verses. A Psalm of David. For the octave. O Lord, do not rebuke me in your fury, nor chastise me in your anger. Psalm 6:2\tHave mercy on me, Lord, for I am weak. Heal me, Lord, for my bones have become disturbed, Psalm 6:3\tand my soul has been very troubled. But as for you, Lord, when? Psalm 6:4\tTurn to me, Lord, and rescue my soul. Save me because of your mercy. Psalm 6:5\tFor there is no one in death who would be mindful of you. And who will confess to you in Hell? Psalm 6:6\tI have labored in my groaning. Every night, with my tears, I will wash my bed and drench my blanket. Psalm 6:7\tMy eye has been troubled by rage. I have grown old among all my enemies. Psalm 6:8\tScatter before me, all you who work iniquity, for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. Psalm 6:9\tThe Lord has heard my supplication. The Lord has accepted my prayer. Psalm 6:10\tLet all my enemies be ashamed and together be greatly troubled. May they be converted and become ashamed very quickly. Psalm 7:1\tA Psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Cush, the son of Jemini. O Lord, my God, in you I have hoped. Save me from all those who persecute me, and free me: Psalm 7:2\tlest at any time, like a lion, he might seize my soul, while there is no one to redeem me, nor any who can save. Psalm 7:3\tO Lord, my God, if there is iniquity in my hands, if I have done this: Psalm 7:4\tif I have repaid those who rendered evils to me, may I deservedly fall away empty before my enemies: Psalm 7:5\tlet the enemy pursue my soul, and take hold of it, and trample my life into the earth, and drag down my glory into the dust. Psalm 7:6\tRise up, Lord, in your anger. And be exalted to the borders of my enemies. And rise up, O Lord my God, according to the precept that you commanded, Psalm 7:7\tand a congregation of people will surround you. And, because of this, return on high. Psalm 7:8\tThe Lord judges the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice and according to my innocence within me. Psalm 7:9\tThe wickedness of sinners will be consumed, and you will direct the just: the examiner of hearts and temperaments is God. Psalm 7:10\tJust is my help from the Lord, who saves the upright of heart. Psalm 7:11\tGod is a just judge, strong and patient. How could he be angry throughout every day? Psalm 7:12\tUnless you will be converted, he will brandish his sword. He has extended his bow and made it ready. Psalm 7:13\tAnd with it, he has prepared instruments of death. He has produced his arrows for those on fire. Psalm 7:14\tBehold him who has given birth to injustice: he has conceived sorrow and has begotten iniquity. Psalm 7:15\tHe has opened a pit and enlarged it. And he has fallen into the hole that he made. Psalm 7:16\tHis sorrow will be turned upon his own head, and his iniquity will descend upon his highest point. Psalm 7:17\tI will confess to the Lord according to his justice, and I will sing a psalm to the name of the Lord Most High. Psalm 8:1\tUnto the end. For the oil and wine presses. A Psalm of David. O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is your name throughout all the earth! For your magnificence is elevated above the heavens. Psalm 8:2\tOut of the mouths of babes and infants, you have perfected praise, because of your enemies, so that you may destroy the enemy and the revenger. Psalm 8:3\tFor I will behold your heavens, the works of your fingers: the moon and the stars, which you have founded. Psalm 8:4\tWhat is man, that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you visit him? Psalm 8:5\tYou reduced him to a little less than the Angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor, Psalm 8:6\tand you have set him over the works of your hands. Psalm 8:7\tYou have subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and in addition: the beasts of the field, Psalm 8:8\tthe birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, which pass through the paths of the sea. Psalm 8:9\tO Lord, our Lord, how admirable is your name throughout all the earth! Psalm 9:1\tUnto the end. For the secrets of the Son. A Psalm of David. I will confess to you, Lord, with my whole heart. I will recount all your wonders. Psalm 9:2\tI will rejoice and exult in you. I will sing a psalm to your name, O Most High. Psalm 9:3\tFor my enemy will be turned back. They will be weakened and perish before your face. Psalm 9:4\tFor you have accomplished my judgment and my cause. You have sat upon the throne that judges justice. Psalm 9:5\tYou have rebuked the Gentiles, and the impious one has perished. You have deleted their name in eternity and for all generations. Psalm 9:6\tThe spears of the enemy have failed in the end, and their cities, you have destroyed. Their memory has perished with a loud noise. Psalm 9:7\tBut the Lord remains in eternity. He has prepared his throne in judgment. Psalm 9:8\tAnd he will judge the whole world in equity. He will judge the people in justice. Psalm 9:9\tAnd the Lord has become a refuge for the poor, a helper in opportunity, in tribulation. Psalm 9:10\tAnd may they hope in you, who know your name. For you have not abandoned those seeking you, Lord. Psalm 9:11\tSing a psalm to the Lord, who dwells in Zion. Announce his study among the Gentiles. Psalm 9:12\tBecause of those who yearned for their blood, he has remembered them. He has not forgotten the cry of the poor. Psalm 9:13\tHave mercy on me, Lord. See my humiliation from my enemies. Psalm 9:14\tYou lift me up from the gates of death, so that I may announce all your praises at the gates of the daughter of Zion. Psalm 9:15\tI will exult in your salvation. The Gentiles have become trapped in the ruin that they made. Their foot has been caught in the same snare that they themselves had hidden. Psalm 9:16\tThe Lord will be recognized when making judgments. The sinner has been caught in the works of his own hands. Psalm 9:17\tThe sinners will be turned into Hell: all the Gentiles who have forgotten God. Psalm 9:18\tFor the poor will not be forgotten in the end. The patience of the poor will not perish in the end. Psalm 9:19\tRise up, Lord: do not let man be strengthened. Let the Gentiles be judged in your sight. Psalm 9:20\tO Lord, establish a lawgiver over them, so that the Gentiles may know that they are only men. Psalm 10:1\tSo then, why, O Lord, have you withdrawn far away? Why have you overlooked us in opportunity, in tribulation? Psalm 10:2\tWhile the impious is arrogant, the poor is enflamed. They are held by the counsels that they devise. Psalm 10:3\tFor the sinner is praised by the desires of his soul, and the iniquitous is blessed. Psalm 10:4\tThe sinner has provoked the Lord; according to the multitude of his wrath, he will not seek him. Psalm 10:5\tGod is not before his sight. His ways are stained at all times. Your judgments are removed from his face. He will be master of all his enemies. Psalm 10:6\tFor he has said in his heart, “I will not be disturbed: from generation to generation without evil.” Psalm 10:7\tHis mouth is full of curses, and bitterness, and deceit. Under his tongue are hardship and sorrow. Psalm 10:8\tHe sits in ambush, with resources in hidden places, so that he may execute the innocent. Psalm 10:9\tHis eyes catch sight of the poor. He lies in ambush, in hiding like a lion in his den. He lies in ambush, so that he may seize the poor, to seize the poor as he draws him in. Psalm 10:10\tWith his snare, he will bring him down. He will crouch down and pounce, when he has power over the poor. Psalm 10:11\tFor he has said in his heart, “God has forgotten, he has turned away his face, lest he see to the end.” Psalm 10:12\tO Lord God, rise up. Let your hand be exalted. Do not forget the poor. Psalm 10:13\tHow has the impious one provoked God? For he has said in his heart, “He will not inquire.” Psalm 10:14\tYou do see, for you examine hardship and sorrow, so that you may deliver them into your hands. The poor one has been abandoned to you. You will be a helper to the orphan. Psalm 10:15\tBreak the arm of the sinner and the malicious. His sin will be sought, and it will not be found. Psalm 10:16\tThe Lord shall reign in eternity, even forever and ever. You will perish the Gentiles from his land. Psalm 10:17\tThe Lord has heeded the desire of the poor. Your ear has listened to the preparation of their heart, Psalm 10:18\tso as to judge for the orphan and the humble, so that man may no longer presume to magnify himself upon the earth. Psalm 11:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm of David. I trust in the Lord. How can you say to my soul, “Sojourn to the mountain, like a sparrow.” Psalm 11:2\tFor behold, the sinners have bent their bow. They have prepared their arrows in the quiver, so as to shoot arrows in the dark at the upright of heart. Psalm 11:3\tFor they have destroyed the things that you have completed. But what has the just one done? Psalm 11:4\tThe Lord is in his holy temple. The Lord’s throne is in heaven. His eyes look upon the poor. His eyelids question the sons of men. Psalm 11:5\tThe Lord questions the just and the impious. Yet he who loves iniquity, hates his own soul. Psalm 11:6\tHe will rain down snares upon sinners. Fire and brimstone and windstorms will be the portion of their cup. Psalm 11:7\tFor the Lord is just, and he has chosen justice. His countenance has beheld equity. Psalm 12:1\tUnto the end. For the octave. A Psalm of David. Save me, O Lord, because holiness has passed away, because truths have been diminished, before the sons of men. Psalm 12:2\tThey have been speaking emptiness, each one to his neighbor; they have been speaking with deceitful lips and a duplicitous heart. Psalm 12:3\tMay the Lord scatter all deceitful lips, along with the tongue that speaks malice. Psalm 12:4\tThey have said: “We will magnify our tongue; our lips belong to us. What is Lord to us?” Psalm 12:5\tBecause of the misery of the destitute and the groaning of the poor, now I will arise, says the Lord. I will place him in safety. I will act faithfully toward him. Psalm 12:6\tThe eloquence of the Lord is pure eloquence, silver tested by fire, purged from the earth, refined seven times. Psalm 12:7\tYou, O Lord, will preserve us, and you will guard us from this generation into eternity. Psalm 12:8\tThe impious wander aimlessly. According to your loftiness, you have multiplied the sons of men. Psalm 13:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm of David. How long, O Lord? Will you forget me until the end? How long will you turn your face away from me? Psalm 13:2\tHow long can I take counsel in my soul, sorrowing in my heart throughout the day? Psalm 13:3\tHow long will my enemy be exalted over me? Psalm 13:4\tLook upon me and listen to me, O Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes, lest I fall asleep forever in death, Psalm 13:5\tlest at any time my enemy may say, “I have prevailed against him.” Those who trouble me will exult, if I have been disturbed. Psalm 13:6\tBut I have hoped in your mercy. My heart will exult in your salvation. I will sing to the Lord, who assigns good things to me. And I will sing psalms to the name of the Lord Most High. Psalm 14:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm of David. The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” They were corrupted, and they have become abominable in their studies. There is no one who does good; there is not even one. Psalm 14:2\tThe Lord has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any who were considering or seeking God. Psalm 14:3\tThey have all gone astray; together they have become useless. There is no one who does good; there is not even one. Their throat is an open sepulcher. With their tongues, they have been acting deceitfully; the venom of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood. Grief and unhappiness are in their ways; and the way of peace, they have not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes. Psalm 14:4\tWill they never learn: all those who work iniquity, who devour my people like a meal of bread? Psalm 14:5\tThey have not called upon the Lord. There, they have trembled in fear, where there was no fear. Psalm 14:6\tFor the Lord is with the just generation. You have confounded the counsel of the needy because the Lord is his hope. Psalm 14:7\tWho will grant the salvation of Israel from Zion? When the Lord turns away the captivity of his people, Jacob will exult, and Israel will rejoice. Psalm 15:1\tA Psalm of David. O Lord, who will dwell in your tabernacle? Or who will rest on your holy mountain? Psalm 15:2\tHe who walks without blemish and who works justice. Psalm 15:3\tHe who speaks the truth in his heart, who has not acted deceitfully with his tongue, and has not done evil to his neighbor, and has not taken up a reproach against his neighbors. Psalm 15:4\tIn his sight, the malicious one has been reduced to nothing, but he glorifies those who fear the Lord. He who swears to his neighbor and does not deceive. Psalm 15:5\tHe who has not given his money in usury, nor accepted bribes against the innocent. He who does these things will be undisturbed for eternity. Psalm 16:1\tThe inscription of a title: of David himself. Preserve me, O Lord, because I have hoped in you. Psalm 16:2\tI have said to the Lord: “You are my God, so you have no need of my goodness.” Psalm 16:3\tAs for the saints, who are in his land: he has made all my desires wonderful in them. Psalm 16:4\tTheir infirmities have been multiplied; after this, they acted more quickly. I will not gather for their convocations of blood, nor will I remember their names with my lips. Psalm 16:5\tThe Lord is the portion of my inheritance and my cup. It is you who will restore my inheritance to me. Psalm 16:6\tThe lots have fallen upon me with clarity. And, indeed, my inheritance has been very clear to me. Psalm 16:7\tI will bless the Lord, who has bestowed understanding upon me. Moreover, my temperament has also corrected me, even through the night. Psalm 16:8\tI have made provision for the Lord always in my sight. For he is at my right hand, so that I may not be disturbed. Psalm 16:9\tBecause of this, my heart has been joyful, and my tongue has exulted. Moreover, even my body will rest in hope. Psalm 16:10\tFor you will not abandon my soul to Hell, nor will you allow your holy one to see corruption. Psalm 16:11\tYou have made known to me the ways of life; you will fill me with joy by your countenance. At your right hand are delights, even to the end. Psalm 17:1\tA Prayer of David. Lord, listen to my justice, attend to my supplication. Pay attention to my prayer, which is not from deceitful lips. Psalm 17:2\tLet my judgment proceed from your presence. Let your eyes behold fairness. Psalm 17:3\tYou have tested my heart and visited it by night. You have examined me by fire, and iniquity has not been found in me. Psalm 17:4\tTherefore, may my mouth not speak the works of men. I have kept to difficult ways because of the words of your lips. Psalm 17:5\tPerfect my steps in your paths, so that my footsteps may not be disturbed. Psalm 17:6\tI have cried out because you, O God, have listened to me. Incline your ear to me and heed my words. Psalm 17:7\tMake your mercies wonderful, for you save those who hope in you. Psalm 17:8\tFrom those who resist your right hand, preserve me like the pupil of your eye. Protect me under the shadow of your wings, Psalm 17:9\tfrom the face of the impious who have afflicted me. My enemies have surrounded my soul. Psalm 17:10\tThey have concealed their fatness; their mouth has been speaking arrogantly. Psalm 17:11\tThey have cast me out, and now they have surrounded me. They have cast their eyes down to the earth. Psalm 17:12\tThey have taken me, like a lion ready for the prey, and like a young lion dwelling in hiding. Psalm 17:13\tRise up, O Lord, arrive before him and displace him. Deliver my soul from the impious one: your spear from the enemies of your hand. Psalm 17:14\tLord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life. Their gut has been filled from your hidden stores. They have been filled with sons, and they have bequeathed to their little ones the remainder. Psalm 17:15\tBut as for me, I will appear before your sight in justice. I will be satisfied when your glory appears. Psalm 18:1\tUnto the end. For David, the servant of the Lord, who spoke the words of this canticle to the Lord, in the day that the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. And he said: I will love you, O Lord my strength. Psalm 18:2\tThe Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my liberator. My God is my helper, and I hope in him: my protector, and the horn of my salvation, and my support. Psalm 18:3\tPraising, I will call upon the Lord. And I will be saved from my enemies. Psalm 18:4\tThe sorrows of death surrounded me, and the torrents of iniquity dismayed me. Psalm 18:5\tThe sorrows of Hell encompassed me, and the snares of death intercepted me. Psalm 18:6\tIn my tribulation, I called upon the Lord, and I cried out to my God. And he listened to my voice from his holy temple. And my cry in his presence entered into his ears. Psalm 18:7\tThe earth was shaken, and it trembled. The foundations of the mountains were disturbed, and they were shaken, because he was angry with them. Psalm 18:8\tA smoke ascended by his wrath, and a fire flared up from his face: coals were kindled by it. Psalm 18:9\tHe bent the heavens, and they descended. And darkness was under his feet. Psalm 18:10\tAnd he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew: he flew upon the feathers of the winds. Psalm 18:11\tAnd he set darkness as his hiding place, with his tabernacle all around him: dark waters in the clouds of the air. Psalm 18:12\tAt the brightness that was before his sight, the clouds crossed by, with hail and coals of fire. Psalm 18:13\tAnd the Lord thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice: hail and coals of fire. Psalm 18:14\tAnd he sent forth his arrows and scattered them. He multiplied lightnings, and he set them in disarray. Psalm 18:15\tThen the fountains of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were revealed, by your rebuke, O Lord, by the inspiration of the Spirit of your wrath. Psalm 18:16\tHe sent from on high, and he accepted me. And he took me up, out of many waters. Psalm 18:17\tHe rescued me from my strongest enemies, and from those who hated me. For they had been too strong for me. Psalm 18:18\tThey intercepted me in the day of my affliction, and the Lord became my protector. Psalm 18:19\tAnd he led me out, into a wide place. He accomplished my salvation, because he willed me. Psalm 18:20\tAnd the Lord will reward me according to my justice, and he will repay me according to the purity of my hands.

Psalm 33:14\tFrom his well-prepared dwelling place, he has gazed upon all who dwell on the earth. Psalm 33:15\tHe has formed the hearts of each one of them; he understands all their works. Psalm 33:16\tThe king is not saved by great power, nor will the giant be saved by his many powers. Psalm 33:17\tThe horse is false safety; for he will not be saved by the abundance of his powers. Psalm 33:18\tBehold, the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him and on those who hope in his mercy, Psalm 33:19\tso as to rescue their souls from death and to feed them during famine. Psalm 33:20\tOur soul remains with the Lord. For he is our helper and protector. Psalm 33:21\tFor in him, our heart will rejoice, and in his holy name, we have hoped. Psalm 33:22\tLet your mercy be upon us, O Lord, just as we have hoped in you. Psalm 34:1\tTo David, when he changed his appearance in the sight of Abimelech, and so he dismissed him, and he went away. I will bless the Lord at all times. His praise will be ever in my mouth. Psalm 34:2\tIn the Lord, my soul will be praised. May the meek listen and rejoice. Psalm 34:3\tMagnify the Lord with me, and let us extol his name in itself. Psalm 34:4\tI sought the Lord, and he heeded me, and he carried me away from all my tribulations. Psalm 34:5\tApproach him and be enlightened, and your faces will not be confounded. Psalm 34:6\tThis poor one cried out, and the Lord heeded him, and he saved him from all his tribulations. Psalm 34:7\tThe Angel of the Lord will encamp around those who fear him, and he will rescue them. Psalm 34:8\tTaste and see that the Lord is sweet. Blessed is the man who hopes in him. Psalm 34:9\tFear the Lord, all you his saints. For there is no destitution for those who fear him. Psalm 34:10\tThe rich have been needy and hungry, but those who seek the Lord will not be deprived of any good thing. Psalm 34:11\tCome forward, sons. Listen to me. I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Psalm 34:12\tWhich is the man who wills life, who chooses to see good days? Psalm 34:13\tProhibit your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. Psalm 34:14\tTurn away from evil, and do good. Inquire about peace, and pursue it. Psalm 34:15\tThe eyes of the Lord are on the just, and his ears are with their prayers. Psalm 34:16\tBut the countenance of the Lord is upon those who do evil, to perish the remembrance of them from the earth. Psalm 34:17\tThe just cried out, and the Lord heard them, and he freed them from all their tribulations. Psalm 34:18\tThe Lord is near to those who are troubled in heart, and he will save the humble in spirit. Psalm 34:19\tMany are the afflictions of the just, but from them all the Lord will free them. Psalm 34:20\tThe Lord preserves all of their bones, not one of them shall be broken. Psalm 34:21\tThe death of a sinner is very harmful, and those who hate the just will fare badly. Psalm 34:22\tThe Lord will redeem the souls of his servants, and none of those who hope in him will fare badly. Psalm 35:1\tOf David himself. O Lord, judge those who harm me; assail those who attack me. Psalm 35:2\tTake hold of weapons and a shield, and rise up in assistance to me. Psalm 35:3\tBring forth the spear, and close in on those who persecute me. Say to my soul, “I am your salvation.” Psalm 35:4\tLet them be confounded and in awe, who pursue my soul. Let them be turned back and be confounded, who think up evil against me. Psalm 35:5\tMay they become like dust before the face of the wind, and let the Angel of the Lord hem them in. Psalm 35:6\tMay their way become dark and slippery, and may the Angel of the Lord pursue them. Psalm 35:7\tFor, without cause, they have concealed their snare for me unto destruction. Over nothing, they have rebuked my soul. Psalm 35:8\tLet the snare, of which he is ignorant, come upon him, and let the deception, which he has hidden, take hold of him: and may he fall into that very snare. Psalm 35:9\tBut my soul will exult in the Lord and delight over his salvation. Psalm 35:10\tAll my bones will say, “Lord, who is like you?” He rescues the needy from the hand of the stronger one, the indigent and the poor from those who plunder him. Psalm 35:11\tUnfair witnesses have risen up, interrogating me about things of which I am ignorant. Psalm 35:12\tThey repaid me evil for good, to the deprivation of my soul. Psalm 35:13\tBut as for me, when they were harassing me, I was clothed with haircloth. I humbled my soul with fasting, and my prayer will become my sinews. Psalm 35:14\tLike a neighbor, and like our brother, so did I please; like one mourning and contrite, so was I humbled. Psalm 35:15\tAnd they have been joyful against me, and they joined together. Scourges have been gathered over me, and I was ignorant of it. Psalm 35:16\tThey have been scattered, yet they were unremorseful. They have tested me. They scoffed at me with scorn. They gnashed their teeth over me. Psalm 35:17\tLord, when will you look down upon me? Restore my soul from before their malice, my only one from before the lions. Psalm 35:18\tI will confess to you in a great Church. I will praise you among a weighty people. Psalm 35:19\tMay those who are my unjust adversaries not be glad over me: those who have hated me without cause, and who nod agreement with their eyes. Psalm 35:20\tFor indeed, they spoke peacefully to me; and speaking with passion to the earth, they intended deceit. Psalm 35:21\tAnd they opened their mouth wide over me. They said, “Well, well, our eyes have seen.” Psalm 35:22\tYou have seen, O Lord, do not be silent. Lord, do not depart from me. Psalm 35:23\tRise up and be attentive to my judgment, to my cause, my God and my Lord. Psalm 35:24\tJudge me according to your justice, O Lord, my God, and do not let them be glad over me. Psalm 35:25\tDo not let them say in their hearts, “Well, well, to our soul.” Neither let them say, “We have devoured him.” Psalm 35:26\tLet them blush and be in awe together, those who congratulate at my misfortunes. Let them be clothed with confusion and awe, who speak great things against me. Psalm 35:27\tLet them exult and rejoice, who wish my justice, and let them ever say, “The Lord be magnified,” who will the peace of his servant. Psalm 35:28\tAnd so my tongue will express your justice: your praise all day long. Psalm 36:1\tUnto the end. To the servant of the Lord, David himself. The unjust one has said within himself that he would commit offenses. There is no fear of God before his eyes. Psalm 36:2\tFor he has acted deceitfully in his sight, such that his iniquity will be found to be hatred. Psalm 36:3\tThe words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit. He is unwilling to understand, so that he may act well. Psalm 36:4\tHe has been considering iniquity on his bed. He has set himself on every way that is not good; moreover, he has not hated evil. Psalm 36:5\tLord, your mercy is in heaven, and your truth is even to the clouds. Psalm 36:6\tYour justice is like the mountains of God. Your judgments are a great abyss. Men and beasts, you will save, O Lord. Psalm 36:7\tHow you have multiplied your mercy, O God! And so the sons of men will hope under the cover of your wings. Psalm 36:8\tThey will be inebriated with the fruitfulness of your house, and you will give them to drink from the torrent of your enjoyment. Psalm 36:9\tFor with you is the fountain of life; and within your light, we will see the light. Psalm 36:10\tExtend your mercy before those who know you, and your justice to these, who are upright in heart. Psalm 36:11\tMay arrogant feet not approach me, and may the hand of the sinner not disturb me. Psalm 36:12\tIn that place, those who work iniquity have fallen. They have been expelled; they were not able to stand. Psalm 37:1\tA Psalm of David himself. Do not choose to imitate the malicious; neither should you envy those who work iniquity. Psalm 37:2\tFor they will quickly wither away like dry grass, and in like manner to kitchen herbs, they will soon droop. Psalm 37:3\tHope in the Lord and do good, and dwell in the land, and so you shall be pastured with its riches. Psalm 37:4\tDelight in the Lord, and he will grant to you the petitions of your heart. Psalm 37:5\tReveal your way to the Lord, and hope in him, and he will accomplish it. Psalm 37:6\tAnd he will bring forth your justice like the light, and your judgment like the midday. Psalm 37:7\tBe subject to the Lord and pray to him. Do not choose to compete with him who prospers in his way, with the man who does injustice. Psalm 37:8\tCease from wrath and leave behind rage. Do not choose to imitate the malicious. Psalm 37:9\tFor those who are malicious will be exterminated. But those who remain with the Lord, these will inherit the land. Psalm 37:10\tYet still a little while, and the sinner will not be. And you will search his place and find nothing. Psalm 37:11\tBut the meek shall inherit the earth, and they will delight in the multitude of peace. Psalm 37:12\tThe sinner will observe the just, and he will gnash his teeth over him. Psalm 37:13\tBut the Lord will laugh at him: for he knows in advance that his day will come. Psalm 37:14\tThe sinners have drawn the sword, they have bent their bow, so as to cast down the poor and the needy, so as to massacre the upright of heart. Psalm 37:15\tLet their sword enter into their own hearts, and let their bow be broken. Psalm 37:16\tA little is better to the just than the many riches of sinners. Psalm 37:17\tFor the arms of sinners will be crushed, but the Lord confirms the just. Psalm 37:18\tThe Lord knows the days of the immaculate, and their inheritance will be in eternity. Psalm 37:19\tThey will not be confounded in an evil time; and in days of famine, they will be satisfied: Psalm 37:20\tfor sinners will perish. Truly, the adversaries of the Lord, soon after they have been honored and exalted, will fade away, in the same way that smoke fades away. Psalm 37:21\tThe sinner will lend and not release, but the just one shows compassion and donates. Psalm 37:22\tFor those who bless him will inherit the earth, but those who curse him will perish. Psalm 37:23\tThe steps of a man will be directed by the Lord, and he will choose his way. Psalm 37:24\tWhen he falls, he will not be harmed, because the Lord places his hand under him. Psalm 37:25\tI have been young, and now I am old; and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his offspring seeking bread. Psalm 37:26\tHe shows compassion and lends, all day long, and his offspring will be in blessing. Psalm 37:27\tTurn away from evil and do good, and dwell forever and ever. Psalm 37:28\tFor the Lord loves judgment, and he will not abandon his saints. They will be kept safe in eternity. The unjust will be punished, and the offspring of the impious will perish. Psalm 37:29\tBut the just will inherit the earth, and they will dwell upon it forever and ever. Psalm 37:30\tThe mouth of the just one will express wisdom, and his tongue will speak judgment. Psalm 37:31\tThe law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be supplanted. Psalm 37:32\tThe sinner considers the just one and seeks to put him to death. Psalm 37:33\tBut the Lord will not abandon him into his hands, nor condemn him, when he will be judged. Psalm 37:34\tWait for the Lord, and keep to his way. And he will exalt you, so as to inherit the land that you may seize. When the sinners will have passed away, then you shall see. Psalm 37:35\tI have seen the impious over-exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of Lebanon. Psalm 37:36\tAnd I passed by, and behold, he was not. And I sought him, and his place was not found. Psalm 37:37\tKeep to innocence, and gaze upon fairness: because there are allotments for the peaceful man. Psalm 37:38\tBut the unjust will be destroyed together: the allotments of the impious will pass away. Psalm 37:39\tBut the salvation of the just is from the Lord, and he is their protector in time of tribulation. Psalm 37:40\tAnd the Lord will help them and free them. And he will rescue them from sinners and save them, because they have hoped in him. Psalm 38:1\tA Psalm of David, in commemoration of the Sabbath. O Lord, do not rebuke me in your fury, nor chastise me in your wrath. Psalm 38:2\tFor your arrows have been driven into me, and your hand has been confirmed over me. Psalm 38:3\tThere is no health in my flesh before the face of your wrath. There is no peace for my bones before the face of my sins. Psalm 38:4\tFor my iniquities have walked over my head, and they have been like a heavy burden weighing upon me. Psalm 38:5\tMy sores have putrefied and been corrupted before the face of my foolishness. Psalm 38:6\tI have become miserable, and I have been bent down, even to the end. I have walked with contrition all day long. Psalm 38:7\tFor my loins have been filled with illusions, and there is no health in my flesh. Psalm 38:8\tI have been afflicted and greatly humbled. I bellowed from the groaning of my heart. Psalm 38:9\tO Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning before you has not been hidden. Psalm 38:10\tMy heart has been disturbed. My strength has abandoned me, and the light of my eyes has abandoned me, and it is not with me. Psalm 38:11\tMy friends and my neighbors have drawn near and stood against me. And those who were next to me stood far apart. And those who sought my soul used violence. Psalm 38:12\tAnd those who sought evil accusations against me were speaking emptiness. And they practiced deceitfulness all day long. Psalm 38:13\tBut, like someone deaf, I did not hear. And I was like someone mute, not opening his mouth. Psalm 38:14\tAnd I became like a man who does not hear, and who has no reproofs in his mouth. Psalm 38:15\tFor in you, Lord, I have hoped. You will listen to me, O Lord my God. Psalm 38:16\tFor I said, “Lest at any time, my enemies might rejoice over me,” and, “While my feet are being shaken, they have spoken great things against me.” Psalm 38:17\tFor I have been prepared for scourges, and my sorrow is ever before me. Psalm 38:18\tFor I will announce my iniquity, and I will think about my sin. Psalm 38:19\tBut my enemies live, and they have been stronger than me. And those who have wrongfully hated me have been multiplied. Psalm 38:20\tThose who render evil for good have dragged me down, because I followed goodness. Psalm 38:21\tDo not forsake me, O Lord my God. Do not depart from me. Psalm 38:22\tBe attentive to my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation. Psalm 39:1\tUnto the end. For Jeduthun himself. A Canticle of David. I said, “I will keep to my ways, so that I will not offend with my tongue.” I posted a guard at my mouth, when a sinner took up a position against me. Psalm 39:2\tI was silenced and humbled, and I was quiet before good things, and my sorrow was renewed. Psalm 39:3\tMy heart grew hot within me, and, during my meditation, a fire would flare up. Psalm 39:4\tI spoke with my tongue, “O Lord, make me know my end, and what the number of my days will be, so that I may know what is lacking to me.” Psalm 39:5\tBehold, you have made my days measurable, and, before you, my substance is as nothing. Yet truly, all things are vanity: every living man. Psalm 39:6\tSo then, truly man passes by like an image; even so, he is disquieted in vain. He stores up, and he knows not for whom he will gather these things. Psalm 39:7\tAnd now, what is it that awaits me? Is it not the Lord? And my substance is with you. Psalm 39:8\tRescue me from all my iniquities. You have handed me over as reproach to the foolish. Psalm 39:9\tI was silenced, and I did not open my mouth, because it was you who acted. Psalm 39:10\tRemove your scourges from me. Psalm 39:11\tI fall short at corrections from the strength of your hand. For you have chastised man for iniquity. And you have made his soul shrink away like a spider. Nevertheless, it is in vain that any man be disquieted. Psalm 39:12\tO Lord, heed my prayer and my supplication. Pay attention to my tears. Do not be silent. For I am a newcomer with you, and a sojourner, just as all my fathers were. Psalm 39:13\tForgive me, so that I may be refreshed, before I will go forth and be no more. Psalm 40:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm of David himself. I have waited expectantly for the Lord, and he was attentive to me. Psalm 40:2\tAnd he heard my prayers and he led me out of the pit of misery and the quagmire. And he stationed my feet upon a rock, and he directed my steps. Psalm 40:3\tAnd he sent a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many will see, and they will fear; and they will hope in the Lord. Psalm 40:4\tBlessed is the man whose hope is in the name of the Lord, and who has no respect for vanities and absurd falsehoods. Psalm 40:5\tYou have accomplished your many wonders, O Lord my God, and there is no one similar to you in your thoughts. I have announced and I have spoken: they are multiplied beyond number. Psalm 40:6\tSacrifice and oblation, you did not want. But you have perfected ears for me. Holocaust and sin offering, you did not require. Psalm 40:7\tThen I said, “Behold, I draw near.” At the head of the book, it has been written of me: Psalm 40:8\tthat I should do your will. My God, I have willed it. And your law is in the midst of my heart. Psalm 40:9\tI have announced your justice in a great Church: behold, I will not restrain my lips. O Lord, you have known it. Psalm 40:10\tI have not concealed your justice within my heart. I have spoken your truth and your salvation. I have not concealed your mercy and your truth from a great assembly. Psalm 40:11\tO Lord, do not take your tender mercies far from me. Your mercy and your truth ever sustain me. Psalm 40:12\tFor evils without number have surrounded me. My iniquities have taken hold of me, and I was not able to see. They have been multiplied beyond the hairs of my head. And my heart has forsaken me. Psalm 40:13\tBe pleased, O Lord, to rescue me. Look down, O Lord, to help me. Psalm 40:14\tLet them together be confounded and awed, who seek after my soul to steal it away. Let them be turned back and be in awe, who wish evils upon me. Psalm 40:15\tLet them bear their confusion all at once, who say to me, “Well, well.” Psalm 40:16\tLet all who seek you exult and rejoice over you. And let those who love your salvation always say, “May the Lord be magnified.” Psalm 40:17\tBut I am a beggar and poor. The Lord has been concerned about me. You are my helper and my protector. My God, do not delay. Psalm 41:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm of David himself. Blessed is he who shows understanding toward the needy and the poor. The Lord will deliver him in the evil day. Psalm 41:2\tMay the Lord preserve him and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth. And may he not hand him over to the will of his adversaries. Psalm 41:3\tMay the Lord bring him help on his bed of sorrow. In his infirmity, you have changed his entire covering. Psalm 41:4\tI said, “O Lord, be merciful to me. Heal my soul, because I have sinned against you.” Psalm 41:5\tMy enemies have spoken evils against me. When will he die and his name perish? Psalm 41:6\tAnd when he came in to see me, he was speaking emptiness. His heart gathered iniquity to itself. He went outside, and he was speaking in the same way. Psalm 41:7\tAll my enemies were whispering against me. They were thinking up evils against me. Psalm 41:8\tThey established an unjust word against me. Will he that sleeps no longer rise again? Psalm 41:9\tFor even the man of my peace, in whom I hoped, who ate my bread, has greatly supplanted me. Psalm 41:10\tBut you, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up again. And I will requite them. Psalm 41:11\tBy this, I knew that you preferred me: because my adversary will not rejoice over me. Psalm 41:12\tBut you have sustained me, because of my innocence, and you have confirmed me in your sight in eternity. Psalm 41:13\tBlessed is the Lord God of Israel, for all generations and even forever. Amen. Amen. Psalm 42:1\tUnto the end. The understanding of the sons of Korah. As the deer longs for fountains of water, so my soul longs for you, O God. Psalm 42:2\tMy soul has thirsted for the strong living God. When will I draw close and appear before the face of God? Psalm 42:3\tMy tears have been my bread, day and night. Meanwhile, it is said to me daily: “Where is your God?” Psalm 42:4\tThese things I have remembered; and my soul within me, I have poured out. For I will cross into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, all the way to the house of God, with a voice of exultation and confession, the sound of feasting. Psalm 42:5\tWhy are you sad, my soul? And why do you disquiet me? Hope in God, for I will still confess to him: the salvation of my countenance, Psalm 42:6\tand my God. My soul has been troubled within myself. Because of this, I will remember you from the land of the Jordan and from Hermon, from the little mountain. Psalm 42:7\tAbyss calls upon abyss, with the voice of your floodgate. All your heights and your waves have passed over me. Psalm 42:8\tIn the daylight, the Lord has ordered his mercy; and in the night, a canticle to him. With me is a prayer to the God of my life. Psalm 42:9\tI will say to God, “You are my supporter. Why have you forgotten me? And why do I walk in mourning, while my adversary afflicts me?” Psalm 42:10\tWhile my bones are being broken, my enemies, who trouble me, have reproached me. Meanwhile, they say to me every single day, “Where is your God?” Psalm 42:11\tMy soul, why are you saddened? And why do you disquiet me? Hope in God, for I will still confess to him: the salvation of my countenance and my God. Psalm 43:1\tA Psalm of David. Judge me, O God, and discern my cause from that of a nation not holy; rescue me from a man unjust and deceitful. Psalm 43:2\tFor you are God, my strength. Why have you rejected me? And why do I walk in sadness, while the adversary afflicts me? Psalm 43:3\tSend forth your light and your truth. They have guided me and led me, to your holy mountain and into your tabernacles. Psalm 43:4\tAnd I will enter, up to the altar of God, to God who enlivens my youthfulness. To you, O God, my God, I will confess upon a stringed instrument. Psalm 43:5\tWhy are you sad, my soul? And why do you disquiet me? Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of my countenance and my God. Psalm 44:1\tUnto the end. To the sons of Korah, toward understanding. Psalm 44:2\tWe have heard, O God, with our own ears. Our fathers have announced to us the work that you wrought in their days and in the days of antiquity. Psalm 44:3\tYour hand dispersed the Gentiles, and you transplanted them. You afflicted a people, and you expelled them. Psalm 44:4\tFor they did not take possession of the land by their sword, and their own arm did not save them. But your right hand and your arm, and the light of your countenance did so, because you were pleased with them. Psalm 44:5\tYou yourself are my king and my God, who commands the salvation of Jacob. Psalm 44:6\tWith you, we will brandish a horn before our enemies; and in your name, we will spurn those rising up against us. Psalm 44:7\tFor I will not hope in my bow, and my sword will not save me. Psalm 44:8\tFor you have saved us from those who afflict us, and you have bewildered those who hate us. Psalm 44:9\tIn God, we will give praise all day long; and in your name, we will confess forever. Psalm 44:10\tBut now, you have rejected and bewildered us, and you will not go forth with our armies, O God. Psalm 44:11\tYou have turned our back to our enemies, and those who hated us have plundered for themselves. Psalm 44:12\tYou have given us over like sheep for food. You have scattered us among the Gentiles. Psalm 44:13\tYou have sold your people without a price, and no great number was exchanged for them. Psalm 44:14\tYou have set us as a disgrace to our neighbors, a scoff and a derision to those who are around us. Psalm 44:15\tYou have set us as a parable among the Gentiles, a shaking of the head among the peoples. Psalm 44:16\tAll day long my shame is before me, and the confusion of my face has covered me, Psalm 44:17\tbefore the voice of the reproacher and the commentator, before the face of the adversary and the pursuer. Psalm 44:18\tAll these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you, and we have not acted unjustly in your covenant. Psalm 44:19\tAnd our heart has not turned back. And you have not diverted our steps from your way. Psalm 44:20\tFor you humbled us in a place of affliction, and the shadow of death has covered us. Psalm 44:21\tIf we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have extended our hands to a foreign god, Psalm 44:22\twill not God find this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart. For, because of you, we are being killed all day long. We are considered as sheep for the slaughter. Psalm 44:23\tRise up. Why do you fall asleep, O Lord? Rise up, and do not reject us in the end. Psalm 44:24\tWhy do you turn your face away, and why do you forget our needfulness and our tribulation? Psalm 44:25\tFor our soul has been humbled into the dust. Our belly has been bound to the earth. Psalm 44:26\tRise up, O Lord. Help us and redeem us, because of your name. Psalm 45:1\tUnto the end. For those who will be changed. To the sons of Korah, toward understanding. A Canticle for the Beloved. My heart has uttered a good word. I speak of my works to the king. My tongue is like the pen of a scribe who writes quickly. Psalm 45:2\tYou are a brilliant form before the sons of men. Grace has been poured freely into your lips. Because of this, God has blessed you in eternity. Psalm 45:3\tFasten your sword to your thigh, O most powerful one. Psalm 45:4\tWith your splendor and your excellence extended, proceed prosperously, and reign for the sake of truth and meekness and justice, and so will your right hand lead you wondrously. Psalm 45:5\tYour arrows are sharp; the people will fall under you, with the hearts of the enemies of the king. Psalm 45:6\tYour throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of true aim. Psalm 45:7\tYou have loved justice and hated iniquity. Because of this, God, your God, has anointed you, before your co-heirs, with the oil of gladness. Psalm 45:8\tMyrrh and balsam and cinnamon perfume your garments, from the houses of ivory. From these, they have delighted you: Psalm 45:9\tthe daughters of kings in your honor. The queen assisted at your right hand, in clothing of gold, encircled with diversity. Psalm 45:10\tListen, daughter, and see, and incline your ear. And forget your people and your father’s house. Psalm 45:11\tAnd the king will desire your beauty. For he is the Lord your God, and they will adore him. Psalm 45:12\tAnd the daughters of Tyre will entreat your countenance with gifts: all the rich men of the people. Psalm 45:13\tAll the glory of the daughter of its king is inside, in golden fringes, Psalm 45:14\tclothed all around with diversities. After her, virgins will be led to the king. Her neighbors will be brought to you. Psalm 45:15\tThey will be brought with gladness and exultation. They will be led into the temple of the king. Psalm 45:16\tFor your fathers, sons have been born to you. You will establish them as leaders over all the earth. Psalm 45:17\tThey will remember your name always, for generation after generation. Because of this, people will confess to you in eternity, even forever and ever. Psalm 46:1\tUnto the end. To the sons of Korah, for confidants. A Psalm. Our God is our refuge and strength, a helper in the tribulations that have greatly overwhelmed us. Psalm 46:2\tBecause of this, we will not be afraid when the earth will be turbulent and the mountains will be transferred into the heart of the sea. Psalm 46:3\tThey thundered, and the waters were stirred up among them; the mountains have been disturbed by his strength. Psalm 46:4\tThe frenzy of the river rejoices the city of God. The Most High has sanctified his tabernacle. Psalm 46:5\tGod is in its midst; it will not be shaken. God will assist it in the early morning. Psalm 46:6\tThe peoples have been disturbed, and the kingdoms have been bowed down. He uttered his voice: the earth has been moved. Psalm 46:7\tThe Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our supporter. Psalm 46:8\tDraw near and behold the works of the Lord: what portents he has set upon the earth, Psalm 46:9\tcarrying away wars even to the end of the earth. He will crush the bow and break the weapons, and he will burn the shield with fire. Psalm 46:10\tBe empty, and see that I am God. I will be exalted among the peoples, and I will be exalted upon the earth. Psalm 46:11\tThe Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our supporter. Psalm 47:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm for the sons of Korah. All nations, clap your hands. Shout joyfully to God with a voice of exultation. Psalm 47:2\tFor the Lord is exalted and terrible: a great King over all the earth. Psalm 47:3\tHe has subjected the peoples to us and subdued the nations under our feet. Psalm 47:4\tHe has chosen us for his inheritance: the splendor of Jacob, whom he has loved. Psalm 47:5\tGod ascends with jubilation, and the Lord with the voice of the trumpet. Psalm 47:6\tSing psalms to our God, sing psalms. Sing psalms to our King, sing psalms. Psalm 47:7\tFor God is the King of all the earth. Sing psalms wisely. Psalm 47:8\tGod will reign over the peoples. God sits upon his holy throne. Psalm 47:9\tThe leaders of the peoples have been gathered together by the God of Abraham. For the strong gods of the earth have been exceedingly exalted. Psalm 48:1\tA Canticle Psalm. To the sons of Korah, on the second Sabbath. The Lord is great and exceedingly praiseworthy, in the city of our God, on his holy mountain. Psalm 48:2\tMount Zion is being founded with the exultation of the whole earth, on the north side, the city of the great king. Psalm 48:3\tIn her houses, God will be known, since he will support her. Psalm 48:4\tFor behold, the kings of the earth have been gathered together; they have convened as one. Psalm 48:5\tSuch did they see, and they were astonished: they were disturbed, they were moved. Psalm 48:6\tTrembling took hold of them. In that place, their pains were that of a woman in labor. Psalm 48:7\tWith a vehement spirit, you will crush the ships of Tarshish. Psalm 48:8\tAs we have heard, so we have seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God. God has founded it in eternity. Psalm 48:9\tWe have received your mercy, O God, in the midst of your temple. Psalm 48:10\tAccording to your name, O God, so does your praise reach to the ends of the earth.

Psalm 48:14\tFor this is God, our God, in eternity and forever and ever. He will rule us forever. Psalm 49:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm to the sons of Korah. Hear these things, all nations. Pay attention, all inhabitants of the world: Psalm 49:2\twhoever is earth-born, you sons of men, together as one, the rich and the poor. Psalm 49:3\tMy mouth will speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart will speak prudence. Psalm 49:4\tI will incline my ear to a parable. I will open my case with the psaltery. Psalm 49:5\tWhy should I fear in the evil day? The iniquity at my heel will surround me. Psalm 49:6\tThose who trust in their own strength and who glory in the multitude of their riches, Psalm 49:7\tno brother redeems, nor will man buy back. He will not give to God his appeasement, Psalm 49:8\tnor the price for the redemption of his soul. And he will labor continuously, Psalm 49:9\tand he will still live, until the end. Psalm 49:10\tHe will not see death, when he sees the wise dying: the foolish and the senseless will perish together. And they will leave their riches to strangers. Psalm 49:11\tAnd their sepulchers will be their houses forever, their tabernacles from generation to generation. They have called their names in their own lands. Psalm 49:12\tAnd man, when he was held in honor, did not understand. He has been compared to the senseless beasts, and he has become like them. Psalm 49:13\tThis way of theirs is a scandal to them. And afterwards, they will delight in their mouth. Psalm 49:14\tThey have been placed in Hell like sheep. Death will feed on them. And the just will have dominion over them in the morning. And their help will grow old in Hell for their glory. Psalm 49:15\tEven so, truly God will redeem my soul from the hand of Hell, when he will receive me. Psalm 49:16\tDo not be afraid, when a man will have been made rich, and when the glory of his house will have been multiplied. Psalm 49:17\tFor when he dies, he will take nothing away, and his glory will not descend with him. Psalm 49:18\tFor his soul will be blessed in his lifetime, and he will admit to you when you do good to him. Psalm 49:19\tHe will even enter with the progeny of his fathers, but, even in eternity, he will not see the light. Psalm 49:20\tMan, when he was in honor, did not understand. He has been compared to the senseless beasts, and he has become like them. Psalm 50:1\tA Psalm of Asaph. The God of gods, the Lord has spoken, and he has called the earth, from the rising of the sun even to its setting, Psalm 50:2\tfrom Zion, the brilliance of his beauty. Psalm 50:3\tGod will arrive manifestly. Our God also will not keep silence. A fire will flare up in his sight, and a mighty tempest will surround him. Psalm 50:4\tHe will call to heaven from above, and to the earth, to discern his people. Psalm 50:5\tGather his holy ones to him, you who order his covenant above sacrifices. Psalm 50:6\tAnd the heavens will announce his justice. For God is the judge. Psalm 50:7\tListen, my people, and I will speak. Listen, Israel, and I will testify for you. I am God, your God. Psalm 50:8\tI will not reprove you for your sacrifices. Moreover, your holocausts are ever in my sight. Psalm 50:9\tI will not accept calves from your house, nor he-goats from your flocks. Psalm 50:10\tFor all the wild beasts of the forest are mine: the cattle on the hills and the oxen. Psalm 50:11\tI know all the flying things of the air, and the beauty of the field is with me. Psalm 50:12\tIf I should be hungry, I would not tell you: for the whole world is mine, and all its plentitude. Psalm 50:13\tShall I gnaw on the flesh of bulls? Or would I drink the blood of goats? Psalm 50:14\tOffer to God the sacrifice of praise, and pay your vows to the Most High. Psalm 50:15\tAnd call upon me in the day of tribulation. I will rescue you, and you will honor me. Psalm 50:16\tBut to the sinner, God has said: Why do you discourse on my justices, and take up my covenant through your mouth? Psalm 50:17\tTruly, you have hated discipline, and you have cast my sermons behind you. Psalm 50:18\tIf you saw a thief, you ran with him, and you have placed your portion with adulterers. Psalm 50:19\tYour mouth has abounded with malice, and your tongue has concocted deceits. Psalm 50:20\tSitting, you spoke against your brother, and you set up a scandal against your mother’s son. Psalm 50:21\tThese things you have done, and I was silent. You thought, unjustly, that I ought to be like you. But I will reprove you, and I will set myself against your face. Psalm 50:22\tUnderstand these things, you who forget God; lest at any time, he might quickly take you away, and there would be no one to rescue you. Psalm 50:23\tThe sacrifice of praise will honor me. And in that place is the journey by which I will reveal to him the salvation of God. Psalm 51:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he went to Bathsheba. Be merciful to me, O God, according to your great mercy. And, according to the plentitude of your compassion, wipe out my iniquity. Psalm 51:2\tWash me once again from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. Psalm 51:3\tFor I know my iniquity, and my sin is ever before me. Psalm 51:4\tAgainst you only have I sinned, and I have done evil before your eyes. And so, you are justified in your words, and you will prevail when you give judgment. Psalm 51:5\tFor behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sinfulness did my mother conceive me. Psalm 51:6\tFor behold, you have loved truth. The obscure and hidden things of your wisdom, you have manifested to me. Psalm 51:7\tYou will sprinkle me with hyssop, and I will be cleansed. You will wash me, and I will be made whiter than snow. Psalm 51:8\tIn my hearing, you will grant gladness and rejoicing. And the bones that have been humbled will exult. Psalm 51:9\tTurn your face away from my sins, and erase all my iniquities. Psalm 51:10\tCreate a clean heart in me, O God. And renew an upright spirit within my inmost being. Psalm 51:11\tDo not cast me away from your face; and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Psalm 51:12\tRestore to me the joy of your salvation, and confirm me with an unsurpassed spirit. Psalm 51:13\tI will teach the unjust your ways, and the impious will be converted to you. Psalm 51:14\tFree me from blood, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will extol your justice. Psalm 51:15\tO Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will announce your praise. Psalm 51:16\tFor if you had desired sacrifice, I would certainly have given it, but with holocausts, you will not be delighted. Psalm 51:17\tA crushed spirit is a sacrifice to God. A contrite and humbled heart, O God, you will not spurn. Psalm 51:18\tAct kindly, Lord, in your good will toward Zion, so that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up. Psalm 51:19\tThen you will accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations, and holocausts. Then they will lay calves upon your altar. Psalm 52:1\tUnto the end. The understanding of David. When Doeg the Edomite came and reported to Saul, David went to the house of Ahimelech. Why do you glory in malice, you who are powerful in iniquity? Psalm 52:2\tAll day long your tongue thinks up injustice. Like a sharp razor, you have wrought deceit. Psalm 52:3\tYou have loved malice above goodness, and iniquity more than speaking righteousness. Psalm 52:4\tYou have loved all precipitous words, you deceitful tongue. Psalm 52:5\tBecause of this, God will destroy you in the end. He will pull you up, and he will remove you from your tabernacle and your root from the land of the living. Psalm 52:6\tThe just will see and be afraid, and they will laugh over him, and say: Psalm 52:7\t“Behold the man who did not set God as his helper. But he hoped in the multitude of his riches, and so he prevailed in his emptiness.” Psalm 52:8\tBut I, like a fruitful olive tree in the house of God, have hoped in the mercy of God unto eternity, and forever and ever. Psalm 52:9\tI will confess to you forever, because you have accomplished it. And I will wait on your name, for it is good in the sight of your saints. Psalm 53:1\tUnto the end. For Mahalath: the thoughts of David. The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” They were corrupted, and they became abominable with iniquities. There is no one who does good. Psalm 53:2\tGod gazed down from heaven on the sons of men, to see if there were any who were considering or seeking God. Psalm 53:3\tAll have gone astray; together they have become useless. There is no one who does good; there is not even one. Psalm 53:4\tWill they never learn: all those who work iniquity, who devour my people like a meal of bread? Psalm 53:5\tThey have not called upon God. In that place, they have trembled in fear, where there was no fear. For God has scattered the bones of those who please men. They have been confounded, because God has spurned them. Psalm 53:6\tWho will grant from Zion the salvation of Israel? Jacob will exult, when God will convert the captivity of his people; and Israel will rejoice. Psalm 54:1\tUnto the end. In verses, the understanding of David, when the Ziphites had arrived and they said to Saul, “Has not David been hidden with us?” Save me, O God, by your name, and judge me in your virtue. Psalm 54:2\tO God, listen to my prayer. Pay attention to the words of my mouth. Psalm 54:3\tFor strangers have risen up against me, and the strong have sought my soul. And they have not set God before their eyes. Psalm 54:4\tFor behold, God is my helper, and the Lord is the protector of my soul. Psalm 54:5\tTurn back the evils upon my adversaries, and ruin them by your truth. Psalm 54:6\tI will freely sacrifice to you, and I will confess your name, O God, because it is good. Psalm 54:7\tFor you have quickly rescued me from all tribulation, and my eye has looked down upon my enemies. Psalm 55:1\tUnto the end. In verses, the understanding of David. Listen to my prayer, O God, and despise not my supplication. Psalm 55:2\tBe attentive to me, and heed me. I have been grieved in my training, and I have been disturbed Psalm 55:3\tat the voice of the adversary and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have diverted iniquities toward me, and they have been harassing me with rage. Psalm 55:4\tMy heart has become disturbed within me, and the dread of death has fallen over me. Psalm 55:5\tFear and trembling have overwhelmed me, and darkness has buried me. Psalm 55:6\tAnd I said, “Who will give me wings like the dove, so that I may fly away and take rest?” Psalm 55:7\tBehold, I have fled far away, and I linger in solitude. Psalm 55:8\tI waited for him who saved me from a weak-minded spirit and from a tempest. Psalm 55:9\tCast them down, O Lord, and divide their tongues. For I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city. Psalm 55:10\tDay and night, iniquity will surround it upon its walls, and hardship is in its midst, Psalm 55:11\twith injustice. And usury and deceit have not fallen away from its streets. Psalm 55:12\tFor if my enemy had spoken evil about me, certainly, I would have sustained it. And if he who hated me had been speaking great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden myself from him. Psalm 55:13\tTruly, you are a man of one mind: my leader and my acquaintance, Psalm 55:14\twho took sweet food together with me. In the house of God, we walked side-by-side. Psalm 55:15\tLet death come upon them, and let them descend alive into Hellfire. For there is wickedness in their dwellings, in their midst. Psalm 55:16\tBut I have cried out to God, and the Lord will save me. Psalm 55:17\tEvening and morning and midday, I will discourse and announce, and he will heed my voice. Psalm 55:18\tHe will redeem my soul in peace from those who draw near to me. For, among the many, they were with me. Psalm 55:19\tGod will hear, and He who is before time will humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God. Psalm 55:20\tHe has stretched forth his hand in retribution. They have contaminated his covenant. Psalm 55:21\tThey were divided by the wrath of his countenance, and his heart has drawn near. His words are smoother than oil, and they are arrows. Psalm 55:22\tCast your cares upon the Lord, and he will nurture you. He will not allow the just to be tossed about forever. Psalm 55:23\tTruly, O God, you will lead them away into the well of death. Bloody and deceitful men will not divide their days in half. But I will hope in you, O Lord. Psalm 56:1\tUnto the end. For the people who have become far removed from the Sacred. Of David, with the inscription of a title, when the Philistines held him in Gath. Psalm 56:2\tHave mercy on me, O God, because man has trampled over me. All day long, he has afflicted me by fighting against me. Psalm 56:3\tMy enemies have trampled over me all day long. For those who make war against me are many. Psalm 56:4\tFrom the height of the day, I will be afraid. But truly, I will hope in you. Psalm 56:5\tIn God, I will praise my words. In God, I have put my trust. I will not fear what flesh can do to me. Psalm 56:6\tAll day long, they curse my words. All their intentions are for evil against me. Psalm 56:7\tThey will dwell and hide themselves. They will watch my heel, just as they waited for my soul; Psalm 56:8\tbecause of this, nothing will save them. In your anger, you will crush the people. Psalm 56:9\tO God, I have announced my life to you. You have placed my tears in your sight, and even in your promise. Psalm 56:10\tThen my enemies will be turned back. On whatever day that I call upon you, behold, I know that you are my God. Psalm 56:11\tIn God, I will praise the word. In the Lord, I will praise his speech. In God, I have hoped. I will not fear what man can do to me. Psalm 56:12\tMy vows to you, O God, are in me. I will repay them. Praises be to you. Psalm 56:13\tFor you have rescued my soul from death and my feet from slipping, so that I may be pleasing in the sight of God, in the light of the living. Psalm 57:1\tUnto the end. May you not destroy. Of David, with the inscription of a title, when he fled from Saul into a cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me. For my soul trusts in you. And I will hope in the shadow of your wings, until iniquity passes away. Psalm 57:2\tI will cry out to God Most High, to God who has been kind to me. Psalm 57:3\tHe sent from heaven and freed me. He has surrendered into disgrace those who trampled me. God has sent his mercy and his truth. Psalm 57:4\tAnd he has rescued my soul from the midst of the young lions. I slept troubled. The sons of men: their teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue is a sharp sword. Psalm 57:5\tBe exalted above the heavens, O God, and your glory above all the earth. Psalm 57:6\tThey prepared a snare for my feet, and they bowed down my soul. They dug a pit before my face, yet they have fallen into it. Psalm 57:7\tMy heart is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared. I will sing, and I will compose a psalm. Psalm 57:8\tRise up, my glory. Rise up, psaltery and harp. I will arise in early morning. Psalm 57:9\tI will confess to you, O Lord, among the peoples. I will compose a psalm to you among the nations. Psalm 57:10\tFor your mercy has been magnified, even to the heavens, and your truth, even to the clouds. Psalm 57:11\tBe exalted above the heavens, O God, and your glory above all the earth. Psalm 58:1\tUnto the end. May you not destroy. Of David, with the inscription of a title. If, truly and certainly, you speak justice, then judge what is right, you sons of men. Psalm 58:2\tFor, even in your heart, you work iniquity. Your hands construct injustice on the earth. Psalm 58:3\tSinners have become foreigners from the womb; they have gone astray from conception. They have been speaking falsehoods. Psalm 58:4\tTheir fury is similar to that of a serpent; it is like a deaf asp, who even blocks her ears, Psalm 58:5\twho will not listen to the voice of charmers, nor even to the enchanter who chants wisely. Psalm 58:6\tGod will crush their teeth within their own mouth. The Lord will break the molars of the lions. Psalm 58:7\tThey will come to nothing, like water flowing away. He has aimed his bow, while they are being weakened. Psalm 58:8\tLike wax that flows, they will be carried away. Fire has fallen upon them, and they will not see the sun. Psalm 58:9\tBefore your thorns could know the brier, he consumes them alive, as if in rage. Psalm 58:10\tThe just one will rejoice when he sees vindication. He will wash his hands in the blood of the sinner. Psalm 58:11\tAnd man will say, “If the just one is fruitful, then, truly, there is a God judging them on earth.” Psalm 59:1\tUnto the end. May you not destroy. Of David, with the inscription of a title, when Saul sent and watched his house, in order to execute him. Rescue me from my enemies, my God, and free me from those who rise up against me. Psalm 59:2\tRescue me from those who work iniquity, and save me from men of blood. Psalm 59:3\tFor behold, they have seized my soul. The strong have rushed upon me. Psalm 59:4\tAnd it is neither my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord. I have run and gone directly, without iniquity. Psalm 59:5\tRise up to meet me, and see: even you, O Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel. Reach out to visit all nations. Do not take pity on all those who work iniquity. Psalm 59:6\tThey will return toward evening, and they will suffer hunger like dogs, and they will wander around the city. Psalm 59:7\tBehold, they will speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips: “For who has heard us?” Psalm 59:8\tAnd you, O Lord, will laugh at them. You will lead all the Gentiles to nothing. Psalm 59:9\tI will guard my strength toward you, for you are God, my supporter. Psalm 59:10\tMy God, his mercy will precede me. Psalm 59:11\tGod will oversee my enemies for me. Do not slay them, lest at times my people may forget them. Scatter them by your virtue. And depose them, O Lord, my protector, Psalm 59:12\tby the offense of their mouth and by the speech of their lips. And may they be caught in their arrogance. And, for their cursing and lying, they will be made known Psalm 59:13\tat the consummation, in the fury of the consummation, and so they will be no more. And they will know that God will rule over Jacob, even to the ends of the earth. Psalm 59:14\tThey will return toward evening, and they will suffer hunger like dogs, and they will wander around the city. Psalm 59:15\tThey will be dispersed in order to gnaw, and truly, when they will not have been satisfied, they will murmur. Psalm 59:16\tBut I will sing your strength, and I will extol your mercy, in the morning. For you have been my supporter and my refuge in the day of my tribulation. Psalm 59:17\tTo you, my helper, I will sing psalms. For you are God, my supporter. My God is my mercy. Psalm 60:1\tUnto the end. For those who will be changed, with the inscription of a title, of David himself, for instruction: when he set fire to Mesopotamia of Syria and Sobal, and Joab turned back and struck Idumea, in the valley of the salt pits, twelve thousand men. O God, you have rejected us, and you have ruined us. You became angry, and yet you have been merciful to us. Psalm 60:2\tYou have moved the earth, and you have disturbed it. Heal its breaches, for it has been moved. Psalm 60:3\tYou have revealed to your people difficulties. You have made us drink the wine of remorse. Psalm 60:4\tYou have given a warning sign to those who fear you, so that they may flee from before the face of the bow, so that your beloved may be delivered. Psalm 60:5\tSave me with your right hand, and hear me. Psalm 60:6\tGod has spoken in his holy place: I will rejoice, and I will divide Shechem, and I will measure the steep valley of the tabernacles. Psalm 60:7\tGilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. And Ephraim is the strength of my head. Judah is my king. Psalm 60:8\tMoab is the cooking pot of my hope. Into Idumea, I will extend my shoe. To me, the foreigners have been made subject. Psalm 60:9\tWho will lead me into the fortified city? Who will lead me all the way to Idumea? Psalm 60:10\tWill not you, O God, who has rejected us? And will not you, O God, go out with our armies? Psalm 60:11\tGrant us help from tribulation. For salvation from man is empty. Psalm 60:12\tIn God, we will act virtuously. And those who trouble us, he will lead to nothing. Psalm 61:1\tUnto the end. With hymns, of David. O God, pay attention to my supplication. Be attentive to my prayer. Psalm 61:2\tI cried out to you from the ends of the earth. When my heart was in anguish, you exalted me on a rock. You have led me, Psalm 61:3\tfor you have been my hope, a tower of strength before the face of the enemy. Psalm 61:4\tI will dwell in your tabernacle forever. I will be protected under the cover of your wings. Psalm 61:5\tFor you, my God, have listened to my prayer. You have granted an inheritance to those who fear your name. Psalm 61:6\tYou will add days to the days of the king, to his years, even to the time of generation after generation. Psalm 61:7\tHe remains in eternity, in the sight of God. Who will long for his mercy and truth? Psalm 61:8\tSo I will compose a psalm to your name, forever and ever, so that I may repay my vows from day to day. Psalm 62:1\tUnto the end. For Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. Will my soul not be subject to God? For from him is my salvation. Psalm 62:2\tYes, he himself is my God and my salvation. He is my supporter; I will be moved no more. Psalm 62:3\tHow is it that you rush against a man? Every one of you puts to death, as if you were pulling down a ruined wall, leaning over and falling apart. Psalm 62:4\tSo, truly, they intended to reject my price. I ran in thirst. They blessed with their mouth and cursed with their heart. Psalm 62:5\tYet, truly, my soul will be subject to God. For from him is my patience. Psalm 62:6\tFor he is my God and my Savior. He is my helper; I will not be expelled. Psalm 62:7\tIn God is my salvation and my glory. He is the God of my help, and my hope is in God. Psalm 62:8\tAll peoples gathered together: trust in him. Pour out your hearts in his sight. God is our helper for eternity. Psalm 62:9\tSo, truly, the sons of men are untrustworthy. The sons of men are liars in the scales, so that, by emptiness, they may deceive among themselves. Psalm 62:10\tDo not trust in iniquity, and do not desire plunder. If riches flow toward you, do not be willing to set your heart on them. Psalm 62:11\tGod has spoken once. I have heard two things: that power belongs to God, Psalm 62:12\tand that mercy belongs to you, O Lord. For you will repay each one according to his works. Psalm 63:1\tA Psalm of David, when he was in the desert of Idumea. O God, my God: to you, I keep vigil until first light. For you, my soul has thirsted, to you my body, in so many ways. Psalm 63:2\tBy a deserted land, both inaccessible and waterless, so I have appeared in the sanctuary before you, in order to behold your virtue and your glory. Psalm 63:3\tFor your mercy is better than life itself. It is you my lips will praise. Psalm 63:4\tSo will I bless you in my life, and I will lift up my hands in your name. Psalm 63:5\tLet my soul be filled, as if with marrow and fatness; and my mouth will give praise with exultant lips. Psalm 63:6\tWhen I have remembered you on my bed in the morning, I will meditate on you. Psalm 63:7\tFor you have been my helper. And I will exult under the cover of your wings. Psalm 63:8\tMy soul has clung close to you. Your right hand has supported me. Psalm 63:9\tTruly, these ones have sought my soul in vain. They will enter into the lower parts of the earth. Psalm 63:10\tThey will be delivered into the hand of the sword. They will be the portions of foxes. Psalm 63:11\tTruly, the king will rejoice in God: all those who swear by him will be praised, because the mouth of those who speak iniquity has been blocked. Psalm 64:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm of David. Hear, O God, my prayer of supplication. Rescue my soul from the fear of the enemy. Psalm 64:2\tYou have protected me from the assembly of the malignant, from a multitude of workers of iniquity. Psalm 64:3\tFor they have sharpened their tongues like a sword; they have formed their bow into a bitter thing, Psalm 64:4\tso that they may shoot arrows from hiding at the immaculate. Psalm 64:5\tThey will suddenly shoot arrows at him, and they will not be afraid. They are resolute in their wicked talk. They have discussed hidden snares. They have said, “Who will see them?” Psalm 64:6\tThey have been searching carefully for iniquities. Their exhaustive search has failed. Man will approach with a deep heart, Psalm 64:7\tand God will be exalted. The arrows of the little ones have become their wounds, Psalm 64:8\tand their tongues have been weakened against them. All those who saw them have been troubled; Psalm 64:9\tand every man was afraid. And they announced the works of God, and they understood his acts. Psalm 64:10\tThe just will rejoice in the Lord, and they will hope in him. And all the upright of heart will be praised. Psalm 65:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm of David. A Canticle of Jeremiah and Ezekiel to the people of the captivity, when they began to go into exile. O God, a hymn adorns you in Zion, and a vow will be repaid to you in Jerusalem. Psalm 65:2\tHear my prayer: all flesh will come to you. Psalm 65:3\tWords of iniquity have prevailed over us. And you will pardon our impieties. Psalm 65:4\tBlessed is he whom you have chosen and taken up. He will dwell in your courts. We will be filled with the good things of your house. Holy is your temple: Psalm 65:5\twonderful in equity. Hear us, O God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of a sea far away. Psalm 65:6\tYou prepare the mountains in your virtue, wrapped with power. Psalm 65:7\tYou stir up the depths of the sea, the noise of its waves. The nations will be troubled, Psalm 65:8\tand those who dwell at the limits will be afraid, before your signs. You will make the passing of morning and evening enjoyable. Psalm 65:9\tYou have visited the earth, and you have saturated it. You have enriched it in so many ways. The river of God has been filled with water. You have prepared their food. For thus is its preparation. Psalm 65:10\tDrench its streams, multiply its fruits; it will spring up and rejoice in its showers. Psalm 65:11\tYou will bless the crown of the year with your kindness, and your fields will be filled with abundance. Psalm 65:12\tThe beauty of the desert will fatten, and the hills will be wrapped with exultation. Psalm 65:13\tThe rams of the sheep have been clothed, and the valleys will abound with grain. They will cry out; yes, they will even utter a hymn. Psalm 66:1\tUnto the end. A Canticle Psalm of the Resurrection. Shout joyfully to God, all the earth. Psalm 66:2\tProclaim a psalm to his name. Give glory to his praise. Psalm 66:3\tExclaim to God, “How terrible are your works, O Lord!” According to the fullness of your virtue, your enemies will speak lies about you. Psalm 66:4\tLet all the earth adore you and sing psalms to you. May it sing a psalm to your name. Psalm 66:5\tDraw near and see the works of God, who is terrible in his counsels over the sons of men. Psalm 66:6\tHe converts the sea into dry land. They will cross the river on foot. There, we will rejoice in him. Psalm 66:7\tHe rules by his virtue for eternity. His eyes gaze upon the nations. May those who exasperate him, not be exalted in themselves. Psalm 66:8\tBless our God, you Gentiles, and make the voice of his praise be heard. Psalm 66:9\tHe has set my soul toward life, and he has granted that my feet may not be shaken. Psalm 66:10\tFor you, O God, have tested us. You have examined us by fire, just as silver is examined. Psalm 66:11\tYou have led us into a snare. You have placed tribulations on our back. Psalm 66:12\tYou have set men over our heads. We have crossed through fire and water. And you have led us out to refreshment. Psalm 66:13\tI will enter your house with holocausts. I will repay my vows to you, Psalm 66:14\twhich my lips discerned and my mouth spoke, in my tribulation. Psalm 66:15\tI will offer to you holocausts full of marrow, with the burnt offerings of rams. I will offer to you bulls as well as goats. Psalm 66:16\tDraw near and listen, all you who fear God, and I will describe to you how much he has done for my soul. Psalm 66:17\tI cried out to him with my mouth, and I extolled him under my breath. Psalm 66:18\tIf I have seen iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not heed me. Psalm 66:19\tAnd yet, God has heeded me and he has attended to the voice of my supplication. Psalm 66:20\tBlessed is God, who has not removed my prayer, nor his mercy, from me. Psalm 67:1\tUnto the end. With hymns, a Canticle Psalm of David. May God have mercy on us and bless us. May he shine his countenance upon us, and may he have mercy on us. Psalm 67:2\tSo may we know your way upon the earth, your salvation among all nations. Psalm 67:3\tLet the peoples confess to you, O God. Let all the peoples confess to you. Psalm 67:4\tMay the nations rejoice and exult. For you judge the peoples with equity, and you direct the nations on earth. Psalm 67:5\tLet the peoples confess to you, O God. Let all the peoples confess to you. Psalm 67:6\tThe earth has provided her fruit. May God, our God, bless us. Psalm 67:7\tMay God bless us, and may all the ends of the earth fear him. Psalm 68:1\tUnto the end. A Canticle Psalm of David himself. May God rise up, and may his enemies be scattered, and may those who hate him flee from before his face. Psalm 68:2\tJust as smoke vanishes, so may they vanish. Just as wax flows away before the face of fire, so may sinners pass away before the face of God. Psalm 68:3\tAnd so, let the just feast, and let them exult in the sight of God and be delighted in gladness. Psalm 68:4\tSing to God, sing a psalm to his name. Make a path for him, who ascends over the west. The Lord is his name. Exult in his sight; they will be stirred up before his face, Psalm 68:5\tthe father of orphans and the judge of widows. God is in his holy place. Psalm 68:6\tIt is God who makes men dwell in a house under one custom. He leads out those who are strongly bound, and similarly, those who exasperate, who dwell in sepulchers. Psalm 68:7\tO God, when you departed in the sight of your people, when you passed through the desert, Psalm 68:8\tthe earth was moved, for the heavens rained down before the face of the God of Sinai, before the face of the God of Israel. Psalm 68:9\tYou will set aside for your inheritance, O God, a willing rain. And though it was weak, truly, you have made it perfect. Psalm 68:10\tYour animals will dwell in it. O God, in your sweetness, you have provided for the poor. Psalm 68:11\tThe Lord will give the word to evangelizers, along with great virtue. Psalm 68:12\tThe King of virtue is beloved among the beloved. And the beauty of the house will divide spoils. Psalm 68:13\tIf you take your rest in the midst of the clergy, you will be like a dove whose wings are covered with fine silver and edged with pale gold. Psalm 68:14\tWhen heaven discerns kings to be over her, they will be whitened with the snows of Zalmon. Psalm 68:15\tThe mountain of God is a fat mountain, a dense mountain, a thick mountain. Psalm 68:16\tSo then, why are you distrustful of dense mountains? The mountain on which God is well pleased to dwell, even there, the Lord will dwell until the end. Psalm 68:17\tThe chariot of God is ten thousand fold: thousands rejoice. The Lord is with them in Sinai, in the holy place. Psalm 68:18\tYou have ascended on high; you have taken captivity captive. You have accepted gifts among men. For even those who do not believe dwell with the Lord God. Psalm 68:19\tBlessed is the Lord, day after day. The God of our salvation will make our journey prosper for us. Psalm 68:20\tOur God is the God who will bring about our salvation, and our Lord is the Lord who has brought an end to death. Psalm 68:21\tSo then, truly, God will break the heads of his enemies, the hairy skull of those who wander around in their offenses. Psalm 68:22\tThe Lord said: I will turn them away from Bashan, I will turn them into the depths of the sea, Psalm 68:23\tso that your feet may be soaked in the blood of your enemies, so that the tongue of your dogs may be soaked with the same. Psalm 68:24\tO God, they have seen your arrival, the arrival of my God, of my king who is in a holy place. Psalm 68:25\tThe leaders went ahead, united with the singers of psalms, in the midst of girls playing on timbrels. Psalm 68:26\tIn the churches, bless the Lord God from the fountains of Israel. Psalm 68:27\tIn that place, Benjamin is a youth in ecstasy of mind. The leaders of Judah are their governors: the leaders of Zebulun, the leaders of Naphtali. Psalm 68:28\tCommand by your virtue, O God. Confirm in this place, O God, what you have wrought in us. Psalm 68:29\tBefore your temple in Jerusalem, kings will offer gifts to you. Psalm 68:30\tRebuke the wild beasts of the reeds, a congregation of bulls with the cows of the people, for they seek to exclude those who have been tested like silver. Scatter the nations that are pleased by wars. Psalm 68:31\tAmbassadors will come out of Egypt. Ethiopia will offer in advance her hands to God. Psalm 68:32\tSing to God, O kingdoms of the earth. Sing psalms to the Lord. Sing psalms to God. Psalm 68:33\tHe ascends, up to the heaven of the heavens, toward the east. Behold, he will utter his voice, the voice of virtue. Psalm 68:34\tGive glory to God beyond Israel. His magnificence and his virtue is in the clouds. Psalm 68:35\tGod is wonderful in his saints. The God of Israel himself will give virtue and strength to his people. Blessed is God. Psalm 69:1\tUnto the end. For those who will be changed: of David. Save me, O God, for the waters have entered, even to my soul. Psalm 69:2\tI have become stuck in a deep quagmire, and there is no firm footing. I have arrived at the height of the sea, and a tempest has overwhelmed me. Psalm 69:3\tI have endured hardships, while crying out. My jaws have become hoarse; my eyes have failed. Meanwhile, I hope in my God. Psalm 69:4\tThose who hate me without cause have been multiplied beyond the hairs of my head. My enemies, who persecuted me unjustly, have been strengthened. Then I was required to pay for what I did not take. Psalm 69:5\tO God, you know my foolishness, and my offenses have not been hidden from you. Psalm 69:6\tLet those who wait for you, O Lord, the Lord of hosts, not be shamed in me. Let those who seek you, O God of Israel, not be confounded over me. Psalm 69:7\tFor because of you, I have endured reproach; confusion has covered my face. Psalm 69:8\tI have become a stranger to my brothers and a sojourner to the sons of my mother. Psalm 69:9\tFor zeal for your house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those who reproached you have fallen upon me. Psalm 69:10\tAnd I covered my soul with fasting, and it has become a reproach to me. Psalm 69:11\tAnd I put on a haircloth as my garment, and I became a parable to them. Psalm 69:12\tThose who sat at the gate spoke against me, and those who drank wine made me their song. Psalm 69:13\tBut as for me, truly, my prayer is to you, O Lord. This time has pleased you well, O God. In the multitude of your mercy, in the truth of your salvation, hear me. Psalm 69:14\tRescue me from the quagmire, so that I may not become trapped. Free me from those who hate me and from deep waters. Psalm 69:15\tDo not allow the tempest of water to submerge me, nor the deep to absorb me. And do not allow the well to close in on me. Psalm 69:16\tHear me, O Lord, for your mercy is kind. Look upon me, according to the fullness of your compassion. Psalm 69:17\tAnd do not turn your face away from your servant, for I am in trouble: heed me quickly. Psalm 69:18\tAttend to my soul, and free it. Rescue me, because of my enemies. Psalm 69:19\tYou know my reproach, and my confusion, and my reverence. Psalm 69:20\tAll those who trouble me are in your sight; my heart has anticipated reproach and misery. And I sought for one who might grieve together with me, but there was no one, and for one who might console me, and I found no one. Psalm 69:21\tAnd they gave me gall for my food. And in my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink. Psalm 69:22\tLet their table be a snare before them, and a retribution, and a scandal. Psalm 69:23\tLet their eyes be darkened, so that they may not see, and may their back always be crooked. Psalm 69:24\tPour out your indignation upon them, and may the fury of your anger take hold of them. Psalm 69:25\tMay their dwelling place be deserted, and may there be no one who dwells in their tabernacles. Psalm 69:26\tFor they persecuted whomever you struck. And they have added to the grief of my wounds. Psalm 69:27\tAssign an iniquity upon their iniquity, and may they not enter into your justice. Psalm 69:28\tDelete them from the Book of the Living, and let them not be written down with the just. Psalm 69:29\tI am poor and sorrowful, but your salvation, O God, has taken me up. Psalm 69:30\tI will praise the name of God with a canticle, and I will magnify him with praise. Psalm 69:31\tAnd it will please God more than a new calf producing horns and hoofs. Psalm 69:32\tLet the poor see and rejoice. Seek God, and your soul will live. Psalm 69:33\tFor the Lord has heard the poor, and he has not despised his prisoners. Psalm 69:34\tLet the heavens and the earth praise him: the sea, and everything that crawls in it. Psalm 69:35\tFor God will save Zion, and the cities of Judah will be built up. And they will dwell there, and they will acquire it by inheritance. Psalm 69:36\tAnd the offspring of his servants will possess it; and those who love his name will dwell in it. Psalm 70:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm of David, in remembrance that the Lord had saved him. O God, reach out to help me. O Lord, hasten to assist me. Psalm 70:2\tMay those who seek my soul be confounded and awed. Psalm 70:3\tMay those who wish evils upon me be turned back and blush with shame. May they be turned away immediately, blushing with shame, who say to me: “Well, well.” Psalm 70:4\tLet all who seek you exult and rejoice in you, and let those who love your salvation forever say: “The Lord be magnified.” Psalm 70:5\tI am truly destitute and poor. O God, assist me. You are my helper and my deliverer. O Lord, do not delay. Psalm 71:1\tA Psalm of David. Of the sons of Jonadab and the former captives. In you, O Lord, I have hoped; do not let me be brought to ruin forever. Psalm 71:2\tFree me by your justice, and rescue me. Incline your ear to me, and save me. Psalm 71:3\tBe a God of protection and a place of strength for me, so that you may accomplish my salvation. For you are my firmament and my refuge. Psalm 71:4\tRescue me, O my God, from the hand of the sinner, and from the hand of the unjust and those who act against the law. Psalm 71:5\tFor you, O Lord, are my patience: my hope from my youth, O Lord. Psalm 71:6\tIn you, I have been confirmed from conception. From my mother’s womb, you are my protector. In you, I will sing forever. Psalm 71:7\tI have become to many as if I were a portent, but you are a strong helper. Psalm 71:8\tLet my mouth be filled with praise, so that I may sing your glory, your greatness all day long. Psalm 71:9\tDo not cast me off in the time of old age. Do not abandon me when my strength will fail. Psalm 71:10\tFor my enemies have spoken against me. And those who watched for my soul have taken counsel as one, Psalm 71:11\tsaying: “God has abandoned him. Pursue and overtake him. For there is no one to rescue him.” Psalm 71:12\tO God, do not be far from me. O my God, provide for my assistance. Psalm 71:13\tMay they be confounded, and may they fail, who drag down my soul. Let them be covered with confusion and shame, who seek evils for me. Psalm 71:14\tBut I will always have hope. And I will add more to all your praise. Psalm 71:15\tMy mouth will announce your justice, your salvation all day long. For I have not known letters. Psalm 71:16\tI will enter into the powers of the Lord. I will be mindful of your justice alone, O Lord. Psalm 71:17\tYou have taught me from my youth, O God. And so I will declare your wonders continuously, Psalm 71:18\teven in old age and with grey hairs. Do not abandon me, O God, while I announce your arm to every future generation: your power Psalm 71:19\tand your justice, O God, even to the highest great things that you have done. O God, who is like you? Psalm 71:20\tHow great is the tribulation that you have revealed to me: very great and evil. And so, turning back, you have brought me to life, and you have led me back again from the abyss of the earth. Psalm 71:21\tYou have multiplied your magnificence. And so, turning back to me, you have consoled me. Psalm 71:22\tTherefore, I will confess your truth to you, with the instruments of the Psalter. O God, I will sing psalms to you with stringed instruments, O Holy One of Israel. Psalm 71:23\tMy lips will exult, when I sing to you, and also my soul, which you have redeemed. Psalm 71:24\tAnd even my tongue will meditate on your justice all day long, when those who seek evils for me have been confounded and set in awe. Psalm 72:1\tA Psalm according to Solomon. Psalm 72:2\tGive your judgment, O God, to the king, and your justice to the king’s son, to judge your people with justice and your poor with judgment. Psalm 72:3\tLet the mountains take up peace for the people, and the hills, justice. Psalm 72:4\tHe will judge the poor of the people, and he will bring salvation to the sons of the poor. And he will humble the false accuser. Psalm 72:5\tAnd he will remain, with the sun and before the moon, from generation to generation. Psalm 72:6\tHe will descend like rain upon fleece, and like showers showering upon the earth. Psalm 72:7\tIn his days, justice will rise like the sun, with abundance of peace, until the moon is taken away. Psalm 72:8\tAnd he will rule from sea to sea and from the river to the limits of the whole world. Psalm 72:9\tIn his sight, the Ethiopians will fall prostrate, and his enemies will lick the ground. Psalm 72:10\tThe kings of Tarshish and the islands will offer gifts. The kings of Arabia and of Seba will bring gifts. Psalm 72:11\tAnd all the kings of the earth shall adore him. All nations will serve him. Psalm 72:12\tFor he will free the poor from the powerful, and the poor one who has no helper. Psalm 72:13\tHe will spare the poor and the indigent, and he will bring salvation to the souls of the poor. Psalm 72:14\tHe will redeem their souls from usuries and from iniquity, and their names shall be honorable in his sight. Psalm 72:15\tAnd he will live, and to him will be given from the gold of Arabia, and by him they will always adore. They will bless him all day long. Psalm 72:16\tAnd there will be a firmament on earth, at the summits of mountains: its fruits will be extolled above Lebanon, and those of the city will flourish like the grass of the earth. Psalm 72:17\tMay his name be blessed forever; may his name remain before the sun. And all the tribes of the earth will be blessed in him. All nations will magnify him. Psalm 72:18\tBlessed is the Lord, God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things. Psalm 72:19\tAnd blessed is the name of his majesty in eternity. And all the earth will be filled with his majesty. Amen. Amen. Psalm 72:20\tThe praises of David, the son of Jesse, have reached an end. Psalm 73:1\tA Psalm of Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to those who are upright in heart. Psalm 73:2\tBut my feet were nearly moved; my steps had nearly slipped. Psalm 73:3\tFor I was zealous over the iniquitous, seeing the peacefulness of sinners. Psalm 73:4\tFor they have no respect for their death, nor do they have support in their wounds. Psalm 73:5\tThey are not with the hardships of men, nor will they be scourged with men. Psalm 73:6\tTherefore, arrogance has held on to them. They have been covered with their iniquity and impiety. Psalm 73:7\tTheir iniquity has proceeded, as if from fat. They have parted from the affection of the heart. Psalm 73:8\tThey have thought and spoken wickedness. They have spoken iniquity in high places. Psalm 73:9\tThey have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has traversed the earth. Psalm 73:10\tTherefore, my people will be converted here, and fullness of days will be found in them. Psalm 73:11\tAnd they said, “How would God know?” and, “Isn’t there knowledge in high places?” Psalm 73:12\tBehold, these are sinners, and, abounding in this age, they have obtained riches. Psalm 73:13\tAnd I said: So then, it is without purpose that I have justified my heart and washed my hands among the innocent. Psalm 73:14\tAnd I have been scourged all day long, and I have received my chastisement in the mornings. Psalm 73:15\tIf I were to say that I would explain this: Behold, I would condemn this nation of your sons. Psalm 73:16\tI considered, so that I might know this. It is a hardship before me, Psalm 73:17\tuntil I may enter into the Sanctuary of God, and understand it to its last part. Psalm 73:18\tSo, because of deceitfulness, truly, you have placed it before them. While they were being lifted up, you were casting them down. Psalm 73:19\tHow have they been brought to desolation? They have suddenly failed. They have perished because of their iniquity. Psalm 73:20\tAs a dream is to those who awaken, O Lord, so will you reduce their image to nothing in your city. Psalm 73:21\tFor my heart has been inflamed, and my temperament has been changed. Psalm 73:22\tAnd so, I have been reduced to nothing, and I did not know it. Psalm 73:23\tI have become like a beast of burden to you, and I am always with you. Psalm 73:24\tYou have held my right hand. And in your will, you have conducted me, and with your glory, you have taken me up. Psalm 73:25\tFor what is there for me in heaven? And what do I wish for on earth before you? Psalm 73:26\tMy body has failed, and my heart: O God of my heart, and God my portion, into eternity. Psalm 73:27\tFor behold, those who put themselves far from you will perish. You have perished all those who fornicate away from you. Psalm 73:28\tBut it is good for me to adhere to God, to put my hope in the Lord God, so that I may announce all your prophecies, at the gates of the daughter of Zion. Psalm 74:1\tThe understanding of Asaph. O God, why have you rejected us to the end. Why has your fury become enraged over the sheep of your pasture? Psalm 74:2\tBe mindful of your congregation, which you have possessed from the beginning. You redeemed the scepter of your inheritance, mount Zion, in which you have dwelt. Psalm 74:3\tLift up your hands against their arrogance in the end. How great the malice of the enemy has been in the sanctuary! Psalm 74:4\tAnd those who hate you have been glorified, in the midst of your solemnity. They have set up their own signs as a proof, Psalm 74:5\tas if it had been issued from on high; yet they did not understand. As in a forest of chopped wood, Psalm 74:6\tthey have cut down the entrances themselves. With axe and hatchet, they have brought it down. Psalm 74:7\tThey have set fire to your Sanctuary. They have polluted the tabernacle of your name on earth. Psalm 74:8\tThey have said in their heart, the whole group of them together: “Let us cause all the feast days of God to cease from the land. Psalm 74:9\tWe have not seen our proof; there is now no prophet. And he will no longer know us.” Psalm 74:10\tHow long, O God, will the enemy place blame? Is the adversary to provoke your name until the end? Psalm 74:11\tWhy do you turn your hand away, even your right hand, from the midst of your sinews, until the end? Psalm 74:12\tBut God is our king before all ages. He has wrought salvation in the midst of the earth. Psalm 74:13\tIn your virtue, you confirmed the sea. You crushed the heads of the serpents in the waters. Psalm 74:14\tYou have broken the heads of the serpent. You have given him as food for the people of the Ethiopians. Psalm 74:15\tYou have disrupted the fountains and the torrents. You have dried up the rivers of Ethan. Psalm 74:16\tYours is the day, and yours is the night. You have made the morning light and the sun. Psalm 74:17\tYou have made all the limits of the earth. The summer and the spring were formed by you. Psalm 74:18\tBe mindful of this: the enemy placed blame against the Lord, and a foolish people has incited against your name. Psalm 74:19\tDo not hand over to beasts the souls that confess to you; and do not forget the souls of your poor until the end. Psalm 74:20\tConsider your covenant. For those who have been darkened upon the earth have been filled by the iniquity of the houses. Psalm 74:21\tDo not allow the humble to be turned away in confusion. The poor and the needy will praise your name. Psalm 74:22\tRise up, O God, judge your own case. Call to mind the accusations against you, which are made by the foolish all day long. Psalm 74:23\tDo not forget the voices of your adversaries. The arrogance of those who hate you rises up continually. Psalm 75:1\tUnto the end. May you not be corrupted. A Canticle Psalm of Asaph. We will confess to you, O God. We will confess, and we will call upon your name. We will describe your wonders. Psalm 75:2\tWhile I have time, I will judge justices. Psalm 75:3\tThe earth has been dissolved, with all who dwell in it. I have confirmed its pillars. Psalm 75:4\tI said to the iniquitous: “Do not act unjustly,” and to the offenders: “Do not exalt the horn.” Psalm 75:5\tDo not exalt your horn on high. Do not speak iniquity against God. Psalm 75:6\tFor it is neither from the east, nor from the west, nor before the desert mountains. Psalm 75:7\tFor God is judge. This one he humbles and that one he exalts. Psalm 75:8\tFor, in the hand of the Lord, there is a cup of undiluted wine, full of consternation. And he has tipped it from here to there. So, truly, its dregs have not been emptied. All the sinners of the earth will drink. Psalm 75:9\tBut I will announce it in every age. I will sing to the God of Jacob. Psalm 75:10\tAnd I will break all the horns of sinners. And the horns of the just will be exalted. Psalm 76:1\tUnto the end. With Praises. A Psalm of Asaph. A Canticle to the Assyrians. In Judea, God is known. In Israel, his name is great. Psalm 76:2\tAnd his place has been formed with peace. And his dwelling place is in Zion. Psalm 76:3\tIn that place, he has broken the powers of the bows, the shield, the sword, and the battle. Psalm 76:4\tYou illuminate wondrously from the mountains of eternity. Psalm 76:5\tAll the foolish of heart have been disturbed. They have slept their sleep, and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands. Psalm 76:6\tAt your rebuke, O God of Jacob, those who were mounted on horseback have fallen asleep. Psalm 76:7\tYou are terrible, and so, who can withstand you? From thence is your wrath. Psalm 76:8\tYou have caused judgment to be heard from heaven. The earth trembled and was quieted, Psalm 76:9\twhen God rose up in judgment in order to bring salvation to all the meek of the earth. Psalm 76:10\tFor the thinking of man will confess to you, and the legacy of his thinking will keep a feast day to you. Psalm 76:11\tMake vows and pay them to the Lord, your God. All you who surround him bring gifts: to him who is terrible, Psalm 76:12\teven to him who takes away the spirit of leaders, to him who is terrible with the kings of the earth. Psalm 77:1\tUnto the end. For Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I cried out to the Lord with my voice, to God with my voice, and he attended to me. Psalm 77:2\tIn the days of my tribulation, I sought God, with my hands opposite him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be consoled. Psalm 77:3\tI was mindful of God, and I was delighted, and I was distressed, and my spirit fell away. Psalm 77:4\tMy eyes anticipated the vigils. I was disturbed, and I did not speak. Psalm 77:5\tI considered the days of antiquity, and I held the years of eternity in my mind. Psalm 77:6\tAnd I meditated in the night with my heart, and I was distressed, and I examined my spirit. Psalm 77:7\tSo then, will God reject for eternity? Will he not continue to allow himself to show favor? Psalm 77:8\tOr, will he cut off his mercy in the end, from generation to generation? Psalm 77:9\tAnd would God ever forget to be merciful? Or, would he, in his wrath, restrict his mercies? Psalm 77:10\tAnd I said, “Now I have begun. This change is from the right hand of the Most High.” Psalm 77:11\tI was mindful of the works of the Lord. For I will be mindful from the beginning of your wonders, Psalm 77:12\tand I will meditate on all your works. And I will take part in your intentions. Psalm 77:13\tYour way, O God, is in what is holy. Which God is great like our God? Psalm 77:14\tYou are the God who performs miracles. You have made your virtue known among the peoples. Psalm 77:15\tWith your arm, you have redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and of Joseph. Psalm 77:16\tThe waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you, and they were afraid, and the depths were stirred up. Psalm 77:17\tGreat was the sound of the waters. The clouds uttered a voice. For your arrows also pass by. Psalm 77:18\tThe voice of your thunder is like a wheel. Your flashes have illuminated the whole world. The earth has quaked and trembled. Psalm 77:19\tYour way is through the sea, and your paths are through many waters. And your traces will not be known. Psalm 77:20\tYou have conducted your people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron. Psalm 78:1\tThe understanding of Asaph. O my people, attend to my law. Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. Psalm 78:2\tI will open my mouth in parables. I will speak about concepts that are from the beginning. Psalm 78:3\tWe have heard and known such great things, as our fathers have described to us. Psalm 78:4\tThese things have not been hidden from their sons in any generation: declaring the praises of the Lord, and his virtues, and the wonders that he has done. Psalm 78:5\tAnd he has received testimony with Jacob, and he has set a law within Israel. Such great things, he has commanded our fathers, so as to make these things known to their sons, Psalm 78:6\tso that another generation might know them, and so that the sons, who will be born and who will grow up, shall describe them to their sons. Psalm 78:7\tSo then, may they put their hope in God, and may they not forget the works of God, and may they seek his commandments. Psalm 78:8\tMay they not become like their fathers, a perverse and exasperating generation: a generation that does not straighten their heart and whose spirit is not trustworthy with God. Psalm 78:9\tThe sons of Ephraim, who bend and shoot the bow, have been turned back in the day of battle. Psalm 78:10\tThey have not kept the covenant of God. And they were not willing to walk in his law. Psalm 78:11\tAnd they have been forgetful of his benefits, and of his miracle, which he revealed to them. Psalm 78:12\tHe performed miracles in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis. Psalm 78:13\tHe broke the sea and he led them through. And he stationed the waters, as if in a vessel. Psalm 78:14\tAnd he led them with a cloud by day, and with illumination by fire throughout the night. Psalm 78:15\tHe broke through the rock in the wasteland, and he gave them to drink, as if from the great abyss. Psalm 78:16\tHe brought forth water from the rock, and he conducted the waters, as if they were rivers. Psalm 78:17\tAnd yet, they continued to sin against him. In a waterless place, they provoked the Most High with resentment. Psalm 78:18\tAnd they tempted God in their hearts, by asking for food according to their desires. Psalm 78:19\tAnd they spoke badly about God. They said, “Would God be able to prepare a table in the desert? Psalm 78:20\tHe struck the rock, and so waters flowed and the torrents flooded, but would even he be able to provide bread, or provide a table, for his people?” Psalm 78:21\tTherefore, the Lord heard, and he was dismayed, and a fire was kindled within Jacob, and an anger ascended into Israel. Psalm 78:22\tFor they neither put their trust in God, nor did they hope in his salvation. Psalm 78:23\tAnd he commanded the clouds from above, and he opened the doors of heaven. Psalm 78:24\tAnd he rained down manna upon them to eat, and he gave them the bread of heaven. Psalm 78:25\tMan ate the bread of Angels. He sent them provisions in abundance. Psalm 78:26\tHe transferred the south wind from heaven, and, in his virtue, he brought in the Southwest wind. Psalm 78:27\tAnd he rained down flesh upon them, as if it were dust, and feathered birds, as if they were the sand of the sea. Psalm 78:28\tAnd they fell down in the midst of their camp, encircling their tabernacles. Psalm 78:29\tAnd they ate until they were greatly satisfied, and he brought to them according to their desires. Psalm 78:30\tThey were not cheated out of what they wanted. Their food was still in their mouth, Psalm 78:31\tand then the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones among them, and he impeded the elect of Israel. Psalm 78:32\tIn all these things, they continued to sin, and they were not trustworthy with his miracles. Psalm 78:33\tAnd their days faded away into vanity, and their years with haste. Psalm 78:34\tWhen he slew them, then they sought him. And they returned, and they drew near to him in the early morning. Psalm 78:35\tAnd they were mindful that God is their helper and that the Most High God is their redeemer. Psalm 78:36\tAnd they chose him with their mouth, and then they lied to him with their tongue. Psalm 78:37\tFor their heart was not upright with him, nor have they been living faithfully in his covenant. Psalm 78:38\tYet he is merciful, and he will pardon their sins. And he will not destroy them. And he has abundantly turned aside his own wrath. And he did not enflame his wrath entirely. Psalm 78:39\tAnd he remembered that they are flesh: with a spirit that goes forth and does not return. Psalm 78:40\tHow often did they provoke him in the desert and stir him to wrath in a waterless place? Psalm 78:41\tAnd they turned back and tempted God, and they exasperated the Holy One of Israel. Psalm 78:42\tThey did not remember his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of the one troubling them. Psalm 78:43\tThus, he positioned his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field of Tanis. Psalm 78:44\tAnd he turned their rivers into blood, along with their rain showers, so that they could not drink. Psalm 78:45\tHe sent among them the common fly, and it devoured them, and the frog, and it scattered them. Psalm 78:46\tAnd he gave up their fruits to mold and their labors to the locust. Psalm 78:47\tAnd he slew their vineyards with hail and their mulberry trees with severe frost. Psalm 78:48\tAnd he delivered their cattle to the hail and their possessions to fire. Psalm 78:49\tAnd he sent the wrath of his indignation among them: indignation and wrath and tribulation, sent forth by evil angels. Psalm 78:50\tHe made way for the path of his anger. He did not spare their souls from death. And he enclosed their beasts of burden in death. Psalm 78:51\tAnd he struck all the first-born in the land of Egypt: the first-fruits of all their labor in the tabernacles of Ham. Psalm 78:52\tAnd he took away his own people like sheep, and he led them through the wilderness like a flock. Psalm 78:53\tAnd he led them out in hope, and they did not fear. And the sea covered their enemies. Psalm 78:54\tAnd he led them to the mountain of his sanctification: the mountain that his right hand had acquired. And he cast out the Gentiles before their face. And he divided their land by lot to them, with a line of distribution. Psalm 78:55\tAnd he caused the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles. Psalm 78:56\tYet they tempted and aggravated God Most High, and they did not keep his testaments. Psalm 78:57\tAnd they turned themselves aside, and they did not serve the covenant. In the same manner as their fathers, they were turned backwards, like a crooked bow. Psalm 78:58\tThey impelled him to anger on their hills, and they provoked him to rivalry with their graven images. Psalm 78:59\tGod listened, and he spurned them, and he reduced Israel greatly, almost to nothing. Psalm 78:60\tAnd he rejected the tabernacle of Shiloh, his tabernacle where he had dwelt among men. Psalm 78:61\tAnd he delivered their virtue into captivity, and their beauty into the hands of the enemy. Psalm 78:62\tAnd he enclosed his people with the sword, and he spurned his inheritance. Psalm 78:63\tFire consumed their young men, and their virgins were not lamented. Psalm 78:64\tTheir priests fell by the sword, and their widows did not weep. Psalm 78:65\tAnd the Lord was awaked, as if out of sleep, and like a powerful man impaired by wine. Psalm 78:66\tAnd he struck his enemies on the back. He gave them over to everlasting disgrace. Psalm 78:67\tAnd he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim. Psalm 78:68\tBut he chose the tribe of Judah: mount Zion, which he loved. Psalm 78:69\tAnd he built up his sanctuary, like a single-horned beast, in the land that he founded for all ages. Psalm 78:70\tAnd he chose his servant David, and he took him from the flocks of the sheep: he received him from following the ewes with their young, Psalm 78:71\tin order to pasture Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance. Psalm 78:72\tAnd he fed them with the innocence of his heart. And he led them with the understanding of his hands. Psalm 79:1\tA Psalm of Asaph. O God, the Gentiles have entered into your inheritance; they have polluted your holy temple. They have set Jerusalem as a place to tend fruit trees. Psalm 79:2\tThey have placed the dead bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints for the beasts of the earth. Psalm 79:3\tThey have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one who would bury them. Psalm 79:4\tWe have become a disgrace to our neighbors, an object of ridicule and mockery to those who are around us. Psalm 79:5\tHow long, O Lord? Will you be angry until the end? Will your zeal be kindled like a fire? Psalm 79:6\tPour out your wrath among the Gentiles, who have not known you, and upon the kingdoms that have not invoked your name. Psalm 79:7\tFor they have devoured Jacob, and they have desolated his place. Psalm 79:8\tDo not remember our iniquities of the past. May your mercies quickly intercept us, for we have become exceedingly poor. Psalm 79:9\tHelp us, O God, our Savior. And free us, Lord, for the glory of your name. And forgive us our sins for the sake of your name. Psalm 79:10\tLet them not say among the Gentiles, “Where is their God?” And may your name become known among the nations before our eyes. For the retribution of your servants’ blood, which has been poured out: Psalm 79:11\tmay the groans of the shackled enter before you. According to the greatness of your arm, take possession of the sons of those who have been killed. Psalm 79:12\tAnd repay our neighbors sevenfold within their sinews. It is the reproach of the same ones who brought reproach against you, O Lord. Psalm 79:13\tBut we are your people and the sheep of your pasture: we will give thanks to you in all ages. From generation to generation, we will announce your praise. Psalm 80:1\tUnto the end. For those who will be changed. The testimony of Asaph. A Psalm. The One who reigns over Israel: Be attentive. For you lead Joseph like a sheep. The One who sits upon the cherubim: Shine forth Psalm 80:2\tin the presence of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Awaken your power and draw near, so as to accomplish our salvation. Psalm 80:3\tConvert us, O God. And reveal your face, and we will be saved. Psalm 80:4\tO Lord, God of hosts, how long will you be angry over the prayer of your servant? Psalm 80:5\tHow long will you feed us the bread of tears, and give us to drink a full measure of tears? Psalm 80:6\tYou have set us as a contradiction to our neighbors. And our enemies have ridiculed us. Psalm 80:7\tO God of hosts, convert us. And reveal your face, and we will be saved. Psalm 80:8\tYou have transferred a vineyard from Egypt. You have cast out the Gentiles, and planted it. Psalm 80:9\tYou were the leader of the journey in its sight. You planted its roots, and it filled the earth. Psalm 80:10\tIts shadow covered the hills, and its branches covered the cedars of God. Psalm 80:11\tIt extended its new branches even to the sea, and its new seedlings even to the river. Psalm 80:12\tSo then, why have you destroyed its walls, so that all those who pass by the way gather its grapes? Psalm 80:13\tThe wild boar of the forest has trampled it, and a single wild beast has laid waste to it. Psalm 80:14\tTurn back, O God of hosts. Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vineyard; Psalm 80:15\tand complete what your right hand has planted, and look upon the son of man, whom you have confirmed for yourself. Psalm 80:16\tWhatever has been set on fire and dug under will perish at the rebuke of your countenance. Psalm 80:17\tLet your hand be over the man on your right, and over the son of man, whom you have confirmed for yourself. Psalm 80:18\tFor we do not depart from you, and you will revive us. And we will invoke your name. Psalm 80:19\tO Lord, God of hosts, convert us. And reveal your face, and we will be saved. Psalm 81:1\tUnto the end. For the wine and oil presses. A Psalm of Asaph himself. Exult before God our helper. Sing joyfully to the God of Jacob. Psalm 81:2\tTake up a psalm, and bring forth the timbrel: a pleasing Psalter with stringed instruments. Psalm 81:3\tSound the trumpet at the new moon, on the noteworthy day of your solemnity, Psalm 81:4\tfor it is a precept in Israel and a judgment for the God of Jacob. Psalm 81:5\tHe set it as a testimony with Joseph, when he went out of the land of Egypt. He heard a tongue that he did not know. Psalm 81:6\tHe turned the burdens away from his back. His hands had been a slave to baskets. Psalm 81:7\tYou called upon me in tribulation, and I freed you. I heard you within the hidden tempest. I tested you with waters of contradiction. Psalm 81:8\tMy people, listen and I will call you to testify. If, O Israel, you will pay heed to me, Psalm 81:9\tthen there will be no new god among you, nor will you adore a foreign god. Psalm 81:10\tFor I am the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt. Widen your mouth, and I will fill it. Psalm 81:11\tBut my people did not hear my voice, and Israel was not attentive to me. Psalm 81:12\tAnd so, I sent them away, according to the desires of their heart. They will go forth according to their own inventions. Psalm 81:13\tIf my people had heard me, if Israel had walked in my ways, Psalm 81:14\tI would have humbled their enemies, as if it were nothing, and I would have sent my hand upon those who troubled them. Psalm 81:15\tThe enemies of the Lord have lied to him, and their time will come, in every age. Psalm 81:16\tAnd he fed them from the fat of the grain, and he saturated them with honey from the rock. Psalm 82:1\tA Psalm of Asaph. God has stood in the synagogue of gods, but, in their midst, he decides between gods. Psalm 82:2\tHow long will you judge unjustly and favor the faces of sinners? Psalm 82:3\tJudge for the indigent and the orphan. Do justice to the humble and the poor. Psalm 82:4\tRescue the poor, and free the needy from the hand of the sinner. Psalm 82:5\tThey did not know and did not understand. They wander in darkness. All the foundations of the earth will be moved. Psalm 82:6\tI said: You are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High. Psalm 82:7\tBut you will die like men, and you will fall just like one of the princes. Psalm 82:8\tRise up, O God. Judge the earth. For you will inherit it with all the nations. Psalm 83:1\tA Canticle Psalm of Asaph. O God, who will ever be like you? Do not be silent, and do not be unmoved, O God. Psalm 83:2\tFor behold, your enemies have sounded off, and those who hate you have carried out a head. Psalm 83:3\tThey have acted with malice in counsel over your people, and they have plotted against your holy ones. Psalm 83:4\tThey have said, “Come, let us scatter them from the nations and not allow the name of Israel to be remembered any longer.” Psalm 83:5\tFor they plotted unanimously. Joined together against you, they ordained a covenant: Psalm 83:6\tthe tabernacle of Edomites and Ishmaelites, and Moab and the Hagarites, Psalm 83:7\tand Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, the foreigners among the inhabitants of Tyre. Psalm 83:8\tFor even Assur comes with them. They have become the helpers of the sons of Lot. Psalm 83:9\tDo to them as you did to Midian and Sisera, just as to Jabin at the torrent of Kishon. Psalm 83:10\tThey perished at Endor, and they became like the dung of the earth. Psalm 83:11\tSet their leaders to be like Oreb and Zeeb, and Zebah and Zalmunna: all their leaders Psalm 83:12\twho said, “Let us possess the Sanctuary of God for an inheritance.” Psalm 83:13\tMy God, set them like a wheel, and like stubble before the face of the wind. Psalm 83:14\tSet them like a fire burning up the forest, and like a flame burning up the mountains. Psalm 83:15\tSo will you pursue them in your tempest, and disturb them in your wrath. Psalm 83:16\tFill their faces with shame, and they will seek your name, O Lord. Psalm 83:17\tLet them be ashamed and troubled, from age to age, and let them be confounded and perish. Psalm 83:18\tAnd let them know that the Lord is your name. You alone are the Most High in all the earth. Psalm 84:1\tUnto the end. For the wine and oil presses. A Psalm to the sons of Korah. How beloved are your tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! Psalm 84:2\tMy soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh have exulted in the living God. Psalm 84:3\tFor even the sparrow has found a home for himself, and the turtle-dove a nest for herself, where she may lay her young: your altars, O Lord of hosts, my king and my God. Psalm 84:4\tBlessed are those who dwell in your house, O Lord. They will praise you from age to age. Psalm 84:5\tBlessed is the man whose help is from you. In his heart, he is disposed to ascend Psalm 84:6\tfrom the valley of tears, from the place which he has determined. Psalm 84:7\tFor even the lawgiver will provide a blessing; they will go from virtue to virtue. The God of gods will be seen in Zion. Psalm 84:8\tO Lord, God of hosts, hear my prayer. Pay attention, O God of Jacob. Psalm 84:9\tO God, gaze upon our protector, and look upon the face of your Christ. Psalm 84:10\tFor one day in your courts is better than thousands elsewhere. I have chosen to be lowly in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tabernacles of sinners. Psalm 84:11\tFor God loves mercy and truth. The Lord will give grace and glory. Psalm 84:12\tHe will not withhold good things from those who walk in innocence. O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man who hopes in you. Psalm 85:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm to the sons of Korah. O Lord, you have blessed your land. You have turned aside the captivity of Jacob. Psalm 85:2\tYou have released the iniquity of your people. You have covered all their sins. Psalm 85:3\tYou have mitigated all your wrath. You have turned aside from the wrath of your indignation. Psalm 85:4\tConvert us, O God, our Savior, and turn your anger away from us. Psalm 85:5\tWill you be angry with us forever? And will you extend your wrath from generation to generation? Psalm 85:6\tO God, you will turn back and revive us. And your people will rejoice in you. Psalm 85:7\tO Lord, reveal to us your mercy, and grant to us your salvation. Psalm 85:8\tI will listen to what the Lord God may be saying to me. For he will speak peace to his people, and to his saints, and to those who are being converted to the heart. Psalm 85:9\tSo then, truly his salvation is near to those who fear him, so that glory may inhabit our land. Psalm 85:10\tMercy and truth have met each other. Justice and peace have kissed. Psalm 85:11\tTruth has risen from the earth, and justice has gazed down from heaven. Psalm 85:12\tFor so will the Lord give goodness, and our earth will give her fruit. Psalm 85:13\tJustice will walk before him, and he will set his steps upon the way. Psalm 86:1\tA Prayer of David himself. Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear me. For I am needy and poor. Psalm 86:2\tPreserve my soul, for I am holy. My God, bring salvation to your servant who hopes in you. Psalm 86:3\tO Lord, be merciful to me, for I have cried out to you all day long. Psalm 86:4\tGive joy to the soul of your servant, for I have lifted up my soul to you, Lord. Psalm 86:5\tFor you are sweet and mild, Lord, and plentiful in mercy to all who call upon you. Psalm 86:6\tPay attention, Lord, to my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplication. Psalm 86:7\tIn the day of my tribulation, I cried out to you, because you heeded me. Psalm 86:8\tThere is no one like you among the gods, O Lord, and there is no one like you in your works. Psalm 86:9\tAll the nations, which you have made, will draw near and adore in your presence, O Lord. And they will glorify your name. Psalm 86:10\tFor you are great, and you perform wonders. You alone are God. Psalm 86:11\tLead me, O Lord, in your way, and I will walk in your truth. May my heart rejoice, so that it will fear your name. Psalm 86:12\tI will confess to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart. And I will glorify your name in eternity. Psalm 86:13\tFor your mercy toward me is great, and you have rescued my soul from the lower part of Hell. Psalm 86:14\tO God, the iniquitous have risen up against me, and the synagogue of the powerful have sought my soul, and they have not placed you in their sight. Psalm 86:15\tAnd you, Lord God, are compassionate and merciful, being patient and full of mercy and truthful. Psalm 86:16\tLook down upon me and have mercy on me. Grant your authority to your servant, and bring salvation to the son of your handmaid. Psalm 86:17\tMake me a sign of what is good, so that those who hate me, may look and be confounded. For you, O Lord, have helped me and consoled me. Psalm 87:1\tA Canticle Psalm to the sons of Korah. Its foundations are in the holy mountains: Psalm 87:2\tthe Lord loves the gates of Zion above all the tabernacles of Jacob. Psalm 87:3\tGlorious things are being said of you, O City of God. Psalm 87:4\tI will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon knowing me. Behold, the foreigners, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians: these have been there. Psalm 87:5\tWill not Zion say that this man and that man were born in her? And the Most High himself has founded her. Psalm 87:6\tThe Lord will explain, in the writings of peoples and of leaders, about those who have been in her. Psalm 87:7\tFor so the dwelling place within you is with all rejoicing. Psalm 88:1\tA Canticle Psalm to the sons of Korah. Unto the end. For Mahalath, to answer the understanding of Heman the Ezrahite. O Lord, God of my salvation: I have cried out, day and night, in your presence. Psalm 88:2\tLet my prayer enter in your sight. Incline your ear to my petition. Psalm 88:3\tFor my soul has been filled with evils, and my life has drawn near to Hell. Psalm 88:4\tI am considered to be among those who will descend into the pit. I have become like a man without assistance, Psalm 88:5\tidle among the dead. I am like the wounded sleeping in sepulchers, whom you no longer remember, and who have been repelled by your hand. Psalm 88:6\tThey have lain me in the lower pit: in dark places and in the shadow of death. Psalm 88:7\tYour fury has been confirmed over me. And you have brought all your waves upon me. Psalm 88:8\tYou have sent my acquaintances far from me. They have set me as an abomination to themselves. I was handed over, yet I did not depart. Psalm 88:9\tMy eyes languished before destitution. All day long, I cried out to you, O Lord. I stretched out my hands to you. Psalm 88:10\tWill you perform wonders for the dead? Or will physicians raise to life, and so confess to you? Psalm 88:11\tCould anyone declare your mercy in the sepulcher, or your truth from within perdition? Psalm 88:12\tWill your wonders be known in the darkness, or your justice in the land of oblivion? Psalm 88:13\tAnd I have cried out to you, O Lord, and in early morning, my prayer will come before you. Psalm 88:14\tLord, why do you reject my prayer? Why do you turn your face away from me? Psalm 88:15\tI am poor, and I have been amid hardships from my youth. And, though I have been exalted, I am humbled and disturbed. Psalm 88:16\tYour wrath has crossed into me, and your terrors have disturbed me. Psalm 88:17\tThey have surrounded me like water, all day long. They have surrounded me, all at once. Psalm 88:18\tFriend and neighbor, and my acquaintances, you have sent far away from me, away from misery. Psalm 89:1\tThe understanding of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing the mercies of the Lord in eternity. I will announce your truth with my mouth, from generation to generation. Psalm 89:2\tFor you have said: Mercy will be built in the heavens, unto eternity. Your truth will be prepared there. Psalm 89:3\tI have set up a covenant with my elect. I have sworn to David my servant: Psalm 89:4\tI will prepare your offspring, even in eternity. And I will build up your throne, from generation to generation. Psalm 89:5\tThe heavens will confess your miracles, Lord, and also your truth, in the Church of the saints. Psalm 89:6\tFor who among the clouds is equal to the Lord? Who among the sons of God is like God? Psalm 89:7\tGod is glorified by the counsel of the saints. He is great and terrible above all those who are around him. Psalm 89:8\tO Lord, God of hosts, who is like you? You are powerful, Lord, and your truth is all around you. Psalm 89:9\tYou rule over the power of the sea, and you even mitigate the movement of its waves. Psalm 89:10\tYou have humbled the arrogant one, like one who has been wounded. You have scattered your enemies with the arm of your strength. Psalm 89:11\tYours are the heavens, and yours is the earth. You founded the whole world in all its fullness. Psalm 89:12\tYou created the north and the sea. Tabor and Hermon will exult in your name. Psalm 89:13\tYour arm acts with power. Let your hand be strengthened, and let your right hand be exalted. Psalm 89:14\tJustice and judgment are the preparation of your throne. Mercy and truth will precede your face. Psalm 89:15\tBlessed is the people that knows jubilation. They will walk in the light of your countenance, O Lord, Psalm 89:16\tand they will exult in your name all day long, and they will be exalted in your justice. Psalm 89:17\tFor you are the glory of their virtue, and in your goodness, our horn will be exalted. Psalm 89:18\tFor our assumption is of the Lord, and it is of our king, the holy one of Israel. Psalm 89:19\tThen you spoke in a vision to your holy ones, and you said: I have stationed help with the powerful one, and I have exalted the elect one from my people. Psalm 89:20\tI have found my servant David. I have anointed him with my holy oil. Psalm 89:21\tFor my hand will assist him, and my arm will fortify him. Psalm 89:22\tThe enemy will have no advantage over him, nor will the son of iniquity be positioned to harm him. Psalm 89:23\tAnd I will cut down his enemies before his face. And those who hate him, I will turn to flight. Psalm 89:24\tAnd my truth and my mercy will be with him. And his horn will be exalted in my name. Psalm 89:25\tAnd I will place his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers. Psalm 89:26\tHe will invoke me: “You are my father, my God, and the support of my salvation.” Psalm 89:27\tAnd I will make him the first-born, preeminent before the kings of the earth. Psalm 89:28\tI will preserve my mercy for him eternally, and my covenant for him faithfully. Psalm 89:29\tAnd I will set his offspring from generation to generation, and his throne like the days of heaven. Psalm 89:30\tBut if his sons abandon my law, and if they do not walk in my judgments, Psalm 89:31\tif they profane my justices, and if they do not keep my commandments: Psalm 89:32\tI will visit their iniquities with a rod, and their sins with a beating. Psalm 89:33\tBut I will not scatter my mercy from him, and I will not do harm to my truth. Psalm 89:34\tAnd I will not profane my covenant, and I will not make void that which proceeds from my lips. Psalm 89:35\tI have sworn by my holiness one time: I will not lie to David, Psalm 89:36\this offspring will remain for eternity. And his throne will be like the sun in my sight, Psalm 89:37\tand, like the moon, it is perfected in eternity, and it is a faithful witness in heaven. Psalm 89:38\tYet, truly, you have rejected and despised, you have pushed away, my Christ. Psalm 89:39\tYou have overthrown the covenant of your servant. You have profaned his sanctuary on earth. Psalm 89:40\tYou have destroyed all his fences. You have made his territory dreadful. Psalm 89:41\tAll who pass by the way have plundered him. He has become a disgrace to his neighbors. Psalm 89:42\tYou have exalted the right hand of those who oppress him. You have brought joy to all his enemies. Psalm 89:43\tYou have diverted the help of his sword, and you have not assisted him in battle. Psalm 89:44\tYou have torn him away from cleansing, and you have smashed his throne down to the ground. Psalm 89:45\tYou have reduced the days of his time. You have flooded him with confusion. Psalm 89:46\tHow long, O Lord? Will you turn away unto the end? Will your wrath flare up like a fire? Psalm 89:47\tRemember what my substance is. For could you really have appointed all the sons of men in vain? Psalm 89:48\tWho is the man that will live, and yet not see death? Who will rescue his own soul from the hand of the underworld? Psalm 89:49\tO Lord, where are your mercies of antiquity, just as you swore to David in your truth? Psalm 89:50\tBe mindful, O Lord, of the disgrace of your servants (which I have sustained in my sinews) among many nations. Psalm 89:51\tWith these, your enemies have reproached you, O Lord; with these, they have reproached the commutation of your Christ. Psalm 89:52\tBlessed is the Lord for all eternity. Amen. Amen. Psalm 90:1\tA prayer of Moses, the man of God. O Lord, you have been our refuge from generation to generation. Psalm 90:2\tBefore the mountains became, or the land was formed along with the world: from ages past, even to all ages, you are God. Psalm 90:3\tAnd, lest man be turned aside in humiliation, you have said: Be converted, O sons of men. Psalm 90:4\tFor a thousand years before your eyes are like the days of yesterday, which have passed by, and they are like a watch of the night, Psalm 90:5\twhich was held for nothing: so their years shall be. Psalm 90:6\tIn the morning, he may pass away like grass; in the morning, he may flower and pass away. In the evening, he will fall, and harden, and become dry. Psalm 90:7\tFor, at your wrath, we have withered away, and we have been disturbed by your fury. Psalm 90:8\tYou have placed our iniquities in your sight, our age in the illumination of your countenance. Psalm 90:9\tFor all our days have faded away, and at your wrath, we have fainted. Our years will be considered to be like a spider’s web. Psalm 90:10\tThe days of our years in them are seventy years. But in the powerful, they are eighty years, and more of these are with hardship and sorrow. For mildness has overwhelmed us, and we shall be corrected. Psalm 90:11\tWho knows the power of your wrath? And, before fear, can your wrath Psalm 90:12\tbe numbered? So make known your right hand, along with men learned in heart, in wisdom. Psalm 90:13\tReturn, O Lord, how long? And may you be persuaded on behalf of your servants. Psalm 90:14\tWe were filled in the morning with your mercy, and we exulted and delighted all our days. Psalm 90:15\tWe have been rejoicing, because of the days in which you humbled us, because of the years in which we saw evils. Psalm 90:16\tLook down upon your servants and upon their works, and direct their sons. Psalm 90:17\tAnd may the splendor of the Lord our God be upon us. And so, direct the works of our hands over us; direct even the work of our hands. Psalm 91:1\tThe Praise of a Canticle, of David. Whoever dwells with the assistance of the Most High will abide in the protection of the God of heaven. Psalm 91:2\tHe will say to the Lord, “You are my supporter and my refuge.” My God, I will hope in him. Psalm 91:3\tFor he has freed me from the snare of those who go hunting, and from the harsh word. Psalm 91:4\tHe will overshadow you with his shoulders, and you will hope under his wings. Psalm 91:5\tHis truth will surround you with a shield. You will not be afraid: before the terror of the night, Psalm 91:6\tbefore the arrow flying in the day, before the troubles that wander in the darkness, nor of invasion and the midday demon. Psalm 91:7\tA thousand will fall before your side and ten thousand before your right hand. Yet it will not draw near you. Psalm 91:8\tSo then, truly, you will consider with your eyes, and you will see the retribution of sinners. Psalm 91:9\tFor you, O Lord, are my hope. You have set the Most High as your refuge. Psalm 91:10\tDisaster will not draw near to you, and the scourge will not approach your tabernacle. Psalm 91:11\tFor he has given his Angels charge over you, so as to preserve you in all your ways. Psalm 91:12\tWith their hands, they will carry you, lest you hurt your foot against a stone. Psalm 91:13\tYou will walk over the asp and the king serpent, and you will trample the lion and the dragon. Psalm 91:14\tBecause he has hoped in me, I will free him. I will protect him because he has known my name. Psalm 91:15\tHe will cry out to me, and I will heed him. I am with him in tribulation. I will rescue him, and I will glorify him. Psalm 91:16\tI will fill him with length of days. And I will reveal to him my salvation. Psalm 92:1\tA Canticle Psalm. On the day of the Sabbath. It is good to confess to the Lord and to sing psalms to your name, O Most High: Psalm 92:2\tto announce your mercy in the morning, and your truth throughout the night, Psalm 92:3\tupon the ten strings, upon the psaltery, with a canticle, upon stringed instruments. Psalm 92:4\tFor you, O Lord, have delighted me with your doings, and I will exult in the works of your hands. Psalm 92:5\tHow great are your works, O Lord! Your thoughts have been made exceedingly deep. Psalm 92:6\tA foolish man will not know these things, and a senseless one will not understand: Psalm 92:7\twhen sinners will have risen up like grass, and when all those who work iniquity will have appeared, that they shall pass away, age after age. Psalm 92:8\tBut you, O Lord, are the Most High for all eternity. Psalm 92:9\tFor behold your enemies, O Lord, for behold your enemies will perish, and all those who work iniquity will be dispersed. Psalm 92:10\tAnd my horn will be exalted like that of the single-horned beast, and my old age will be exalted in fruitful mercy. Psalm 92:11\tAnd my eye has looked down upon my enemies, and my ear will hear of the malignant rising up against me. Psalm 92:12\tThe just one will flourish like the palm tree. He will be multiplied like the cedar of Lebanon. Psalm 92:13\tThose planted in the house of the Lord will flourish in the courts of the house of our God. Psalm 92:14\tThey will still be multiplied in a fruitful old age, and they will endure well, Psalm 92:15\tso that they may announce that the Lord our God is righteous and that there is no iniquity in him. Psalm 93:1\tThe Praise of a Canticle, of David himself. In the time before the Sabbath, when the earth was founded. The Lord has reigned. He has been clothed with beauty.

You are from everlasting. Psalm 93:3\tThe floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice. The floods have lifted up their waves, Psalm 93:4\tbefore the noise of many waters.

Psalm 94:1\tA Psalm of David himself. The Fourth Sabbath. The Lord is the God of retribution. The God of retribution acts in order to deliver. Psalm 94:2\tLift yourself up, for you judge the earth. Repay the arrogant with retribution. Psalm 94:3\tHow long will sinners, O Lord, how long will sinners glory? Psalm 94:4\tHow long will they utter and speak iniquity? How long will all who work injustice speak out? Psalm 94:5\tThey have humiliated your people, O Lord, and they have harassed your inheritance. Psalm 94:6\tThey have executed the widow and the new arrival, and they have slaughtered the orphan. Psalm 94:7\tAnd they have said, “The Lord will not see, nor will the God of Jacob understand.” Psalm 94:8\tUnderstand, you senseless ones among the people. And be wise at last, you foolish ones. Psalm 94:9\tHe who formed the ear, will he not hear? And he who forged the eye, does he not look closely? Psalm 94:10\tHe who chastises nations, he who teaches man knowledge, will he not rebuke? Psalm 94:11\tThe Lord knows the thoughts of men: that these are in vain. Psalm 94:12\tBlessed is the man whom you will instruct, O Lord. And you will teach him from your law. Psalm 94:13\tSo may you soothe him from the evil days, until a pit may be dug for sinners. Psalm 94:14\tFor the Lord will not drive away his people, and he will not abandon his inheritance, Psalm 94:15\teven until the time when justice is being converted into judgment, and when those who are close to justice are all those who are upright of heart. Psalm 94:16\tWho will rise up with me against the malignant? Or who will stand with me against the workers of iniquity? Psalm 94:17\tExcept that the Lord assisted me, my soul almost would have dwelt in Hell. Psalm 94:18\tIf ever I said, “My foot is slipping,” then your mercy, O Lord, assisted me. Psalm 94:19\tAccording to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, your consolations have given joy to my soul. Psalm 94:20\tDoes the seat of iniquity adhere to you, you who contrive hardship within a commandment? Psalm 94:21\tThey will hunt down the soul of the just, and they will condemn innocent blood. Psalm 94:22\tAnd the Lord has been made into a refuge for me, and my God into the assistance of my hope. Psalm 94:23\tAnd he will repay them their iniquity, and he will destroy them in their malice.

Psalm 102:24\tDo not call me back in the middle of my days: your years are from generation to generation. Psalm 102:25\tIn the beginning, O Lord, you founded the earth. And the heavens are the work of your hands. Psalm 102:26\tThey will perish, but you remain. And all will grow old like a garment. And, like a blanket, you will change them, and they will be changed.

Psalm 103:8\tThe Lord is compassionate and merciful, patient and full of mercy. Psalm 103:9\tHe will not be angry forever, and he will not threaten for eternity.

Psalm 103:11\tFor according to the height of the heavens above the earth, so has he reinforced his mercy toward those who fear him. Psalm 103:12\tAs far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our iniquities from us. Psalm 103:13\tAs a father is compassionate to his sons, so has the Lord been compassionate to those who fear him. Psalm 103:14\tFor he knows our form. He has called to mind that we are dust. Psalm 103:15\tMan: his days are like hay. Like the flower of the field, so will he flourish. Psalm 103:16\tFor the spirit in him will pass away, and it will not remain, and he will know his place no longer. Psalm 103:17\tBut the mercy of the Lord is from eternity, and even unto eternity, upon those who fear him. And his justice is with the sons of the sons, Psalm 103:18\twith those who serve his covenant and have been mindful of his commandments by doing them.

You have clothed yourself with confession and beauty; Psalm 104:2\tyou are dressed with light like a garment, while you stretch out heaven like a tent. Psalm 104:3\tYou cover its heights with water. You set the clouds as your stairs. You walk upon the wings of the winds. Psalm 104:4\tYou make your Angels a breath of life, and your ministers a burning fire. Psalm 104:5\tYou founded the earth upon its stable base. It will not be bent from age to age. Psalm 104:6\tThe abyss, like a garment, is its clothing. The waters will remain standing above the mountains. Psalm 104:7\tAt your rebuke, they will flee. At the voice of your thunder, they will dread. Psalm 104:8\tThe mountains ascend, and the plains descend, to the place which you have founded for them. Psalm 104:9\tYou have set a limit that they will not cross. And they will not return to cover the earth. Psalm 104:10\tYou spring forth fountains in steep valleys. The waters will cross through the midst of the mountains. Psalm 104:11\tAll the wild beasts of the field will drink. The wild donkeys will anticipate in their thirst. Psalm 104:12\tAbove them, the flying things of the air will dwell. From the midst of the rocks, they will utter voices. Psalm 104:13\tYou irrigate the mountains from your heights. The earth will be satiated from the fruit of your works, Psalm 104:14\tproducing grass for cattle and herbs for the service of men. So may you draw bread from the earth, Psalm 104:15\tand wine, in order to cheer the heart of man. Then he may gladden his face with oil, and bread will confirm the heart of man. Psalm 104:16\tThe trees of the field will be saturated, along with the cedars of Lebanon, which he planted. Psalm 104:17\tThere, the sparrows will make their nests. The leader of them is the house of the heron. Psalm 104:18\tThe heights of the hills are for the deer; the rock is a refuge for the hedgehog. Psalm 104:19\tHe has made the moon for seasons; the sun knows its setting. Psalm 104:20\tYou appointed darkness, and it has become night; all the beasts of the forest will cross through it. Psalm 104:21\tThe young lions will roar, while searching for and seizing their meal from God. Psalm 104:22\tThe sun arose, and they were gathered together; and in their dens, they will lie down together. Psalm 104:23\tMan will go forth to his work and to his activities, until the evening. Psalm 104:24\tHow great are your works, O Lord! You have made all things in wisdom. The earth has been filled with your possessions. Psalm 104:25\tThis sea is great and its hands are spacious. There are creeping things without number: the small animals with the great. Psalm 104:26\tThere, the ships will pass by this sea-serpent that you have formed to mock them. Psalm 104:27\tAll these expect you to give them food in due time. Psalm 104:28\tWhat you give to them, they will gather. When you open your hand, they will all be filled with goodness.

Psalm 105:8\tHe has remembered his covenant for all ages: the word that he entrusted to a thousand generations, Psalm 105:9\twhich he assigned to Abraham, and his oath to Isaac.

Psalm 105:17\tHe sent a man before them: Joseph, who had been sold as a slave. Psalm 105:18\tThey humbled his feet in shackles; the iron pierced his soul, Psalm 105:19\tuntil his word arrived. The eloquence of the Lord inflamed him. Psalm 105:20\tThe king sent and released him; he was the ruler of the people, and he dismissed him. Psalm 105:21\tHe established him as master of his house and ruler of all his possessions, Psalm 105:22\tso that he might instruct his princes as himself, and teach his elders prudence. Psalm 105:23\tAnd Israel entered into Egypt, and Jacob became a sojourner in the land of Ham. Psalm 105:24\tAnd he helped his people greatly, and he strengthened them over their enemies. Psalm 105:25\tHe turned their heart to hate his people, and to deal deceitfully with his servants. Psalm 105:26\tHe sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, the one whom he chose. Psalm 105:27\tHe placed with them signs of his word, and portents in the land of Ham. Psalm 105:28\tHe sent darkness and made it conceal, and he did not afflict them with his speech. Psalm 105:29\tHe turned their waters into blood, and he slaughtered their fish. Psalm 105:30\tTheir land brought forth frogs, even in the inner chambers of their kings. Psalm 105:31\tHe spoke, and there came forth common flies and gnats, in every region. Psalm 105:32\tHe gave them a shower of hail and a burning fire, in the same land. Psalm 105:33\tAnd he struck their vineyards and their fig trees, and he crushed the trees of their region. Psalm 105:34\tHe spoke, and the locust came forth, and the caterpillar, of which there was no number.

Psalm 105:36\tAnd he struck all the first-born in their land, the first-fruits of all their labor. Psalm 105:37\tAnd he led them out with silver and gold, and there was not an infirm one among their tribes. Psalm 105:38\tEgypt was joyful at their departure, for the fear of them lay heavy upon them. Psalm 105:39\tHe spread a cloud for their protection, and a fire, to give them light through the night.

Visit us with your salvation, Psalm 106:5\tso that we may see the goodness of your elect, so that we may rejoice in the joy of your nation, so that you may be praised along with your inheritance. Psalm 106:6\tWe have sinned, as have our fathers. We have acted unjustly; we have wrought iniquity. Psalm 106:7\tOur fathers did not understand your miracles in Egypt. They did not remember the multitude of your mercies. And they provoked you, while going up to the sea, even the Red Sea. Psalm 106:8\tAnd he saved them for the sake of his name, so that he might make known his power. Psalm 106:9\tAnd he rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up. And he led them into the abyss, as if into a desert. Psalm 106:10\tAnd he saved them from the hand of those who hated them. And he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. Psalm 106:11\tAnd the water covered those who troubled them. Not one of them remained. Psalm 106:12\tAnd they believed his words, and they sang his praises. Psalm 106:13\tAs soon as they had finished, they forgot his works, and they would not endure his counsel.

Psalm 106:18\tAnd a fire broke out in their congregation. A flame burned up the sinners. Psalm 106:19\tAnd they fashioned a calf at Horeb, and they adored a graven image. Psalm 106:20\tAnd they exchanged their glory for the likeness of a calf that eats hay. Psalm 106:21\tThey forgot God, who saved them, who did great things in Egypt: Psalm 106:22\tmiracles in the land of Ham, terrible things at the Red Sea. Psalm 106:23\tAnd he said that he would destroy them, yet Moses, his elect, stood firm before him in the breach, in order to avert his wrath, lest he destroy them. Psalm 106:24\tAnd they held the desirable land to be nothing. They did not trust in his word. Psalm 106:25\tAnd they murmured in their tabernacles. They did not heed the voice of the Lord. Psalm 106:26\tAnd he lifted up his hand over them, in order to prostrate them in the desert, Psalm 106:27\tand in order to cast their offspring among the nations, and to scatter them among the regions. Psalm 106:28\tAnd they were initiated into Baal of Peor, and they ate the sacrifices of the dead. Psalm 106:29\tAnd they provoked him with their inventions, and ruination was multiplied in them. Psalm 106:30\tThen Phinehas stood up and placated him: and so the violent disturbance ceased. Psalm 106:31\tAnd it was reputed to him unto justice, from generation to generation, even forever. Psalm 106:32\tAnd they provoked him at the Waters of Contradiction, and Moses was afflicted because of them, Psalm 106:33\tfor they exasperated his spirit. And so he divided them with his lips. Psalm 106:34\tThey did not destroy the nations, about which the Lord had spoken to them. Psalm 106:35\tAnd they were mixed among the Gentiles. And they learned their works, Psalm 106:36\tand they served their graven images, and it became a scandal to them. Psalm 106:37\tAnd they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons. Psalm 106:38\tAnd they shed innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of their daughters, which they sacrificed to the graven images of Canaan. And the land was infected with bloodshed, Psalm 106:39\tand was contaminated with their works. And they fornicated according to their own inventions. Psalm 106:40\tAnd the Lord became furiously angry with his people, and he abhorred his inheritance. Psalm 106:41\tAnd he delivered them into the hands of the nations. And those who hated them became rulers over them. Psalm 106:42\tAnd their enemies afflicted them, and they were humbled under their hands. Psalm 106:43\tMany times, he delivered them. Yet they provoked him with their counsel, and they were brought low by their iniquities. Psalm 106:44\tAnd he saw that they were in tribulation, and he heard their prayer. Psalm 106:45\tAnd he was mindful of his covenant, and he repented according to the multitude of his mercies. Psalm 106:46\tAnd he provided for them with mercies, in the sight of all those who had seized them.

Psalm 107:4\tThey wandered into solitude in a waterless place. They did not find the way of the city to be their dwelling place. Psalm 107:5\tThey were hungry, and they were thirsty.

Psalm 107:7\tAnd he led them in the right way, so that they might go forth to a city of habitation. Psalm 107:8\tLet his mercies confess to the Lord, and let his miracles confess to the sons of men. Psalm 107:9\tFor he has satisfied the empty soul, and he has satisfied the hungry soul with good things: Psalm 107:10\tthose sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, shackled by extreme poverty and by iron. Psalm 107:11\tFor they exasperated the eloquence of God, and they irritated the deliberation of the Most High. Psalm 107:12\tAnd their heart was brought low with hardships. They were weakened, and there was no one to help them. Psalm 107:13\tAnd they cried out to the Lord in their tribulation, and he freed them from their distress. Psalm 107:14\tAnd he led them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and he broke apart their chains. Psalm 107:15\tLet his mercies confess to the Lord, and let his miracles confess to the sons of men. Psalm 107:16\tFor he has crushed the gates of brass and broken the iron bars.

Psalm 107:23\tThose who descend to the sea in ships, making their livelihood in the great waters: Psalm 107:24\tthese have seen the works of the Lord and his wonders in the deep. Psalm 107:25\tHe spoke: and a windstorm stood up, and its waves were exalted. Psalm 107:26\tThey ascend even to the heavens, and they descend even to the abyss. Their soul will waste away in distress. Psalm 107:27\tThey were troubled, and they moved like a drunkard, and all their wisdom was consumed. Psalm 107:28\tAnd they cried out to the Lord in their tribulation, and he led them out of their distress. Psalm 107:29\tAnd he replaced the storm with a breeze, and its waves were stilled. Psalm 107:30\tAnd they were joyful that it was stilled, and he led them into the haven that they desired. Psalm 107:31\tLet his mercies confess to the Lord, and let his miracles confess to the sons of men. Psalm 107:32\tAnd let them exalt him in the Church of the people, and praise him in the chair of the elders.

Psalm 107:37\tAnd they sowed fields and planted vineyards, and they produced the fruit of nativity. Psalm 107:38\tAnd he blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly. And he did not diminish their beasts of burden. Psalm 107:39\tAnd they became few, and they were afflicted by the tribulation of evils and of sorrow. Psalm 107:40\tContempt was poured over their leaders, and he caused them to wander in an impassable place, and not on the way. Psalm 107:41\tAnd he helped the poor out of destitution, and he stationed families like sheep. Psalm 107:42\tThe upright will see, and they will rejoice. And every iniquity will block its mouth. Psalm 107:43\tWho is wise and will keep these things? And who will understand the mercies of the Lord? Psalm 108:1\tA Canticle Psalm, of David himself. My heart is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared. I will sing songs, and I will sing psalms in my glory. Psalm 108:2\tRise up, my glory. Rise up, Psalter and harp. I will arise in early morning.

Psalm 108:11\tWill not you, O God, who had rejected us? And will not you, O God, go out with our armies? Psalm 108:12\tGrant us help from tribulation, for vain is the help of man. Psalm 108:13\tIn God, we will act virtuously, and he will bring our enemies to nothing. Psalm 109:1\tUnto the end. A Psalm of David. Psalm 109:2\tO God, do not be silent toward my praise, for the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the deceitful one have been opened against me. Psalm 109:3\tThey have spoken against me with deceitful tongues, and they have surrounded me with hateful words, and they fought against me over nothing. Psalm 109:4\tInstead of choosing to act on my behalf, they detracted me. But I gave myself to prayer. Psalm 109:5\tAnd they set evil against me, instead of good, and hatred, in return for my love. Psalm 109:6\tEstablish the sinner over him, and let the devil stand at his right hand. Psalm 109:7\tWhen he is judged, may he go forth in condemnation, and may his prayer be counted as sin. Psalm 109:8\tMay his days be few, and let another take his episcopate. Psalm 109:9\tMay his sons be orphans, and his wife a widow. Psalm 109:10\tMay his sons be carried by those who walk unsteadily, and may they go begging. And may they be cast out of their dwelling places. Psalm 109:11\tMay the money lenders scrutinize all his belongings, and let foreigners plunder his labors. Psalm 109:12\tMay there be no one to assist him, nor anyone to be compassionate to his orphaned children. Psalm 109:13\tMay his posterity be in utter ruin. In one generation, may his name be wiped away. Psalm 109:14\tMay the iniquity of his fathers return in memory before the sight of the Lord, and do not let the sin of his mother be wiped away. Psalm 109:15\tMay these be opposite the Lord always, but let their memory perish from the earth. Psalm 109:16\tFor certain things are not remembered about them, in order to be merciful. Psalm 109:17\tAnd so the destitute man was pursued, with the beggar and the remorseful in heart, so as to be put to death. Psalm 109:18\tAnd he loved a curse, and it came to him. And he was unwilling to have a blessing, and it went far from him. And he clothed himself with curses like a garment, and it entered his inner self like water, and it entered his bones like oil. Psalm 109:19\tMay it be to him like a garment that covers him, and like a belt that always cinches him. Psalm 109:20\tThis is the work of those who detract me with the Lord and who speak evils against my soul. Psalm 109:21\tBut as for you, Lord, O Lord: act on my behalf for your name’s sake. For your mercy is sweet. Psalm 109:22\tFree me, for I am destitute and poor, and my heart has been disquieted within me. Psalm 109:23\tI have been taken away like a shadow when it declines, and I have been shaken off like locusts. Psalm 109:24\tMy knees have been weakened by fasting, and my flesh has been replaced by oil. Psalm 109:25\tAnd I have become a disgrace to them. They saw me, and they shook their heads. Psalm 109:26\tHelp me, O Lord, my God. Save me according to your mercy. Psalm 109:27\tAnd let them know that this is your hand, and that you, O Lord, have done this. Psalm 109:28\tThey will curse, and you will bless. May those who rise up against me be confounded. But your servant will rejoice. Psalm 109:29\tMay those who detract me be clothed with shame, and may they be covered with their confusion, as if with a double cloak. Psalm 109:30\tI will confess exceedingly to the Lord with my mouth. And I will praise him in the midst of the multitude. Psalm 109:31\tFor he stands at the right hand of the poor, in order to save my soul from persecutors. Psalm 110:1\tA Psalm of David. The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.” Psalm 110:2\tThe Lord will send forth the scepter of your virtue from Zion. Rule in the midst of your enemies. Psalm 110:3\tIt is with you from the beginning, in the day of your virtue, in the splendor of the saints. From conception, before the light-bearer, I begot you. Psalm 110:4\tThe Lord has sworn, and he will not repent: “You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.” Psalm 110:5\tThe Lord is at your right hand. He has broken kings in the day of his wrath. Psalm 110:6\tHe will judge between the nations; he will fill up ruination. He will shatter heads in the land of the many.

He will not be disturbed, until he looks down upon his enemies. Psalm 112:9\tHe has distributed, he has given to the poor. His justice shall remain from age to age. His horn shall be exalted in glory. Psalm 112:10\tThe sinner will see and become angry. He will gnash his teeth and waste away. The desire of sinners will perish. Psalm 113:1\tAlleluia. Praise the Lord, children. Praise the name of the Lord. Psalm 113:2\tBlessed is the name of the Lord, from this time forward and even forever. Psalm 113:3\tFrom the rising of the sun, even to its setting, praiseworthy is the name of the Lord. Psalm 113:4\tThe Lord is high above all nations, and his glory is high above the heavens. Psalm 113:5\tWho is like the Lord, our God, who dwells on high, Psalm 113:6\tand who gazes upon the humble things in heaven and on earth? Psalm 113:7\tHe lifts up the needy from the ground, and he urges the poor away from filth, Psalm 113:8\tso that he may place him with the leaders, with the leaders of his people.

The Jordan was turned back again. Psalm 114:4\tThe mountains exulted like rams, and the hills like lambs among the sheep. Psalm 114:5\tWhat happened to you, O sea, so that you fled, and to you, O Jordan, so that you were turned back again? Psalm 114:6\tWhat happened to you, O mountains, so that you exulted like rams, and to you, O hills, so that you exulted like lambs among the sheep? Psalm 114:7\tBefore the face of the Lord, the earth was moved, before the face of the God of Jacob. Psalm 114:8\tHe converted the rock into pools of water, and the cliff into fountains of waters. Psalm 115:1\tNot to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory. Psalm 115:2\tGive glory to your mercy and your truth, lest the Gentiles should say, “Where is their God?” Psalm 115:3\tBut our God is in heaven. All things whatsoever that he has willed, he has done. Psalm 115:4\tThe idols of the nations are silver and gold, the works of the hands of men. Psalm 115:5\tThey have mouths, and do not speak; they have eyes, and do not see. Psalm 115:6\tThey have ears, and do not hear; they have noses, and do not smell. Psalm 115:7\tThey have hands, and do not feel; they have feet, and do not walk. Neither will they cry out with their throat. Psalm 115:8\tLet those who make them become like them, along with all who trust in them. Psalm 115:9\tThe house of Israel has hoped in the Lord.
