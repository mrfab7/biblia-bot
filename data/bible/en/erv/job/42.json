Psalm 1:1\tBOOK I Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. Psalm 1:2\tBut his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. Psalm 1:3\tAnd he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also doth not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. Psalm 1:4\tThe wicked are not so; but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. Psalm 1:5\tTherefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. Psalm 1:6\tFor the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the wicked shall perish. Psalm 2:1\tWhy do the nations rage, and the peoples imagine a vain thing? Psalm 2:2\tThe kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, Psalm 2:3\tLet us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. Psalm 2:4\tHe that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. Psalm 2:5\tThen shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure: Psalm 2:6\tYet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. Psalm 2:7\tI will tell of the decree: the LORD said unto me, Thou art my son; this day have I begotten thee. Psalm 2:8\tAsk of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Psalm 2:9\tThou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. Psalm 2:10\tNow therefore be wise, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Psalm 2:11\tServe the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Psalm 2:12\tKiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him. Psalm 3:1\tA Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. LORD, how are mine adversaries increased! many are they that rise up against me. Psalm 3:2\tMany there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah Psalm 3:3\tBut thou, O LORD, art a shield about me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. Psalm 3:4\tI cry unto the LORD with my voice, and he answereth me out of his holy hill. Selah Psalm 3:5\tI laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustaineth me. Psalm 3:6\tI will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people, that have set themselves against me round about. Psalm 3:7\tArise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. Psalm 3:8\tSalvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah Psalm 4:1\tFor the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; thou hast set me at large when I was in distress: have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. Psalm 4:2\tO ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonour? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah Psalm 4:3\tBut know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him. Psalm 4:4\tStand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah Psalm 4:5\tOffer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. Psalm 4:6\tMany there be that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. Psalm 4:7\tThou hast put gladness in my heart, more than they have when their corn and their wine are increased. Psalm 4:8\tIn peace will I both lay me down and sleep: for thou, LORD, alone makest me dwell in safety. Psalm 5:1\tFor the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. Psalm 5:2\tHearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee do I pray. Psalm 5:3\tO LORD, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; in the morning will I order my prayer unto thee, and will keep watch. Psalm 5:4\tFor thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: evil shall not sojourn with thee. Psalm 5:5\tThe arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. Psalm 5:6\tThou shalt destroy them that speak lies: the LORD abhorreth the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. Psalm 5:7\tBut as for me, in the multitude of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. Psalm 5:8\tLead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way plain before my face. Psalm 5:9\tFor there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness: their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. Psalm 5:10\tHold them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels: thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. Psalm 5:11\tBut let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice, let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. Psalm 5:12\tFor thou wilt bless the righteous; O LORD, thou wilt compass him with favour as with a shield. Psalm 6:1\tFor the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. Psalm 6:2\tHave mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am withered away: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed. Psalm 6:3\tMy soul also is sore vexed: and thou, O LORD, how long? Psalm 6:4\tReturn, O LORD, deliver my soul: save me for thy lovingkindness’ sake. Psalm 6:5\tFor in death there is no remembrance of thee: in Sheol who shall give thee thanks? Psalm 6:6\tI am weary with my groaning; every night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. Psalm 6:7\tMine eye wasteth away because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine adversaries. Psalm 6:8\tDepart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. Psalm 6:9\tThe LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. Psalm 6:10\tAll mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore vexed: they shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly. Psalm 7:1\tShiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD; concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me: Psalm 7:2\tLest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. Psalm 7:3\tO LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; Psalm 7:4\tIf I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary:) Psalm 7:5\tLet the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah Psalm 7:6\tArise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries: and awake for me; thou hast commanded judgment. Psalm 7:7\tAnd let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about: and over them return thou on high. Psalm 7:8\tThe LORD ministereth judgment to the peoples: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that is in me. Psalm 7:9\tOh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. Psalm 7:10\tMy shield is with God, which saveth the upright in heart. Psalm 7:11\tGod is a righteous judge, yea, a God that hath indignation every day. Psalm 7:12\tIf a man turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. Psalm 7:13\tHe hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he maketh his arrows fiery shafts. Psalm 7:14\tBehold, he travaileth with iniquity; yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood. Psalm 7:15\tHe hath made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. Psalm 7:16\tHis mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate. Psalm 7:17\tI will give thanks unto the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High. Psalm 8:1\tFor the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory upon the heavens. Psalm 8:2\tOut of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, because of thine adversaries, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. Psalm 8:3\tWhen I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; Psalm 8:4\tWhat is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? Psalm 8:5\tFor thou hast made him but little lower than God, and crownest him with glory and honour. Psalm 8:6\tThou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: Psalm 8:7\tAll sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; Psalm 8:8\tThe fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. Psalm 8:9\tO LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! Psalm 9:1\tFor the Chief Musician; set to Muthlabben. A Psalm of David. I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvelous works. Psalm 9:2\tI will be glad and exult in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High. Psalm 9:3\tWhen mine enemies turn back, they stumble and perish at thy presence. Psalm 9:4\tFor thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging righteously. Psalm 9:5\tThou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. Psalm 9:6\tThe enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; and the cities which thou hast overthrown, their very memorial is perished. Psalm 9:7\tBut the LORD sitteth as king for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. Psalm 9:8\tAnd he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness. Psalm 9:9\tThe LORD also will be a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble; Psalm 9:10\tAnd they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. Psalm 9:11\tSing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. Psalm 9:12\tFor he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the poor. Psalm 9:13\tHave mercy upon me, O LORD; behold my affliction which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; Psalm 9:14\tThat I may shew forth all thy praise: in the gates of the daughter of Zion, I will rejoice in thy salvation. Psalm 9:15\tThe nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. Psalm 9:16\tThe LORD hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah Psalm 9:17\tThe wicked shall return to Sheol, even all the nations that forget God. Psalm 9:18\tFor the needy shall not alway be forgotten, nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever. Psalm 9:19\tArise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the nations be judged in thy sight. Psalm 9:20\tPut them in fear, O LORD: let the nations know themselves to be but men. Selah Psalm 10:1\tWhy standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? Psalm 10:2\tIn the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. Psalm 10:3\tFor the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and the covetous renounceth, yea, contemneth the LORD. Psalm 10:4\tThe wicked, in the pride of his countenance, saith, He will not require it. All his thoughts are, There is no God. Psalm 10:5\tHis ways are firm at all times; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them. Psalm 10:6\tHe saith in his heart, I shall not be moved: to all generations I shall not be in adversity. Psalm 10:7\tHis mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: under his tongue is mischief and iniquity. Psalm 10:8\tHe sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the covert places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the helpless. Psalm 10:9\tHe lurketh in the covert as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net. Psalm 10:10\tHe croucheth, he boweth down, and the helpless fall by his strong ones. Psalm 10:11\tHe saith in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it. Psalm 10:12\tArise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the poor. Psalm 10:13\tWherefore doth the wicked contemn God, and say in his heart, Thou wilt not require it? Psalm 10:14\tThon hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to take it into thy hand: the helpless committeth himself unto thee; thou hast been the helper of the fatherless. Psalm 10:15\tBreak thou the arm of the wicked; and as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none. Psalm 10:16\tThe LORD is King for ever and ever: the nations are perished out of his land. Psalm 10:17\tLORD, thou hast heard the desire of the meek: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: Psalm 10:18\tTo judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man which is of the earth may be terrible no more. Psalm 11:1\tFor the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? Psalm 11:2\tFor, lo, the wicked bend the bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. Psalm 11:3\tIf the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? Psalm 11:4\tThe LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD, his throne is in heaven; his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. Psalm 11:5\tThe LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. Psalm 11:6\tUpon the wicked he shall rain snares; fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup. Psalm 11:7\tFor the LORD is righteous; he loveth righteousness: the upright shall behold his face. Psalm 12:1\tFor the Chief Musician; set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. Psalm 12:2\tThey speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak. Psalm 12:3\tThe LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh great things: Psalm 12:4\tWho have said, with our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us? Psalm 12:5\tFor the spoiling of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety at whom they puff. Psalm 12:6\tThe words of the LORD are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace on the earth, purified seven times. Psalm 12:7\tThou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. Psalm 12:8\tThe wicked walk on every side, when vileness is exalted among the sons of men. Psalm 13:1\tFor the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. How long, O LORD, wilt thou forget me for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? Psalm 13:2\tHow long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart all the day? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? Psalm 13:3\tConsider and answer me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; Psalm 13:4\tLest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved. Psalm 13:5\tBut I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation: Psalm 13:6\tI will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. Psalm 14:1\tFor the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; there is none that doeth good. Psalm 14:2\tThe LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek after God. Psalm 14:3\tThey are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Psalm 14:4\tHave all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. Psalm 14:5\tThere were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous. Psalm 14:6\tYe put to shame the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge. Psalm 14:7\tOh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. Psalm 15:1\tA Psalm of David. LORD, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? Psalm 15:2\tHe that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh truth in his heart. Psalm 15:3\tHe that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his friend, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. Psalm 15:4\tIn whose eyes a reprobate is despised; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. Psalm 15:5\tHe that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved. Psalm 16:1\tMichtam of David. Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. Psalm 16:2\tI have said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: I have no good beyond thee. Psalm 16:3\tAs for the saints that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all my delight. Psalm 16:4\tTheir sorrows shall be multiplied that exchange the LORD for another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take their names upon my lips. Psalm 16:5\tThe LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. Psalm 16:6\tThe lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. Psalm 16:7\tI will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: yea, my reins instruct me in the night seasons. Psalm 16:8\tI have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Psalm 16:9\tTherefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall dwell in safety. Psalm 16:10\tFor thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol; neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption. Psalm 16:11\tThou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; in thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. Psalm 17:1\tA Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry; give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. Psalm 17:2\tLet my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes look upon equity. Psalm 17:3\tThou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and findest nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. Psalm 17:4\tAs for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent. Psalm 17:5\tMy steps have held fast to thy paths, my feet have not slipped. Psalm 17:6\tI have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech. Psalm 17:7\tShew thy marvelous lovingkindness, O thou that savest them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them, by thy right hand. Psalm 17:8\tKeep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, Psalm 17:9\tFrom the wicked that spoil me, my deadly enemies, that compass me about. Psalm 17:10\tThey are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. Psalm 17:11\tThey have now compassed us in our steps: they set their eyes to cast us down to the earth. Psalm 17:12\tHe is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. Psalm 17:13\tArise, O LORD, confront him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword; Psalm 17:14\tFrom men, by thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, whose portion is in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure: they are satisfied with children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. Psalm 17:15\tAs for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. Psalm 18:1\tFor the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: and he said, I love thee, O LORD, my strength. Psalm 18:2\tThe LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strong rock, in him will I trust; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower. Psalm 18:3\tI will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. Psalm 18:4\tThe cords of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodliness made me afraid. Psalm 18:5\tThe cords of Sheol were round about me: the snares of death came on me. Psalm 18:6\tIn my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry before him came into his ears. Psalm 18:7\tThen the earth shook and trembled, me foundations also of the mountains moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. Psalm 18:8\tThere went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. Psalm 18:9\tHe bowed the heavens also, and came down, and thick darkness was under his feet. Psalm 18:10\tAnd he rode upon a cherub, and did fly, yea, he flew swiftly upon the wings of the wind. Psalm 18:11\tHe made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion round about him; darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies. Psalm 18:12\tAt the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire. Psalm 18:13\tThe LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice; hailstones and coals of fire. Psalm 18:14\tAnd he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; yea, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them. Psalm 18:15\tThen the channels of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid bare, at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. Psalm 18:16\tHe sent from on high, he took me; he drew me out of many waters. Psalm 18:17\tHe delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me. Psalm 18:18\tThey came upon me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. Psalm 18:19\tHe brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me. Psalm 18:20\tThe LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. Psalm 18:21\tFor I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. Psalm 18:22\tFor all his judgments were before me, and I put not away his statutes from me. Psalm 18:23\tI was also perfect with him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. Psalm 18:24\tTherefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.

Psalm 34:3\tO magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. Psalm 34:4\tI sought the LORD, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears. Psalm 34:5\tThey looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces shall never be confounded. Psalm 34:6\tThis poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. Psalm 34:7\tThe angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. Psalm 34:8\tO taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. Psalm 34:9\tO fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. Psalm 34:10\tThe young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing. Psalm 34:11\tCome, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD. Psalm 34:12\tWhat man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? Psalm 34:13\tKeep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Psalm 34:14\tDepart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. Psalm 34:15\tThe eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. Psalm 34:16\tThe face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. Psalm 34:17\tThe righteous cried, and the LORD heard, and delivered them out of all their troubles. Psalm 34:18\tThe LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. Psalm 34:19\tMany are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all. Psalm 34:20\tHe keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. Psalm 34:21\tEvil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be condemned. Psalm 34:22\tThe LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be condemned. Psalm 35:1\tA Psalm of David. Strive thou, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight thou against them that fight against me. Psalm 35:2\tTake hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. Psalm 35:3\tDraw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that pursue me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. Psalm 35:4\tLet them be ashamed and brought to dishonour that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and confounded that devise my hurt. Psalm 35:5\tLet them be as chaff before the wind, and the angel of the LORD driving them on. Psalm 35:6\tLet their way be dark and slippery, and the angel of the LORD pursuing them. Psalm 35:7\tFor without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, without cause have they digged a pit for my soul. Psalm 35:8\tLet destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: with destruction let him fall therein. Psalm 35:9\tAnd my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation. Psalm 35:10\tAll my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him? Psalm 35:11\tUnrighteous witnesses rise up; they ask me of things that I know not. Psalm 35:12\tThey reward me evil for good, to the bereaving of my soul. Psalm 35:13\tBut as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I afflicted my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. Psalm 35:14\tI behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother: I bowed down mourning, as one that bewaileth his mother. Psalm 35:15\tBut when I halted they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not: Psalm 35:16\tLike the profane mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth. Psalm 35:17\tLord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions. Psalm 35:18\tI will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people. Psalm 35:19\tLet not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. Psalm 35:20\tFor they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land. Psalm 35:21\tYea, they opened their mouth wide against me; they said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it. Psalm 35:22\tThou hast seen it, O LORD; keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me. Psalm 35:23\tStir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord. Psalm 35:24\tJudge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me. Psalm 35:25\tLet them not say in their heart, Aha, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up. Psalm 35:26\tLet them be ashamed and confounded together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me. Psalm 35:27\tLet them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, The LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. Psalm 35:28\tAnd my tongue shall talk of thy righteousness, and of thy praise all the day long. Psalm 36:1\tFor the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD. The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes. Psalm 36:2\tFor he flattereth himself in his own eyes, that his iniquity shall not be found out and be hated. Psalm 36:3\tThe words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise and to do good. Psalm 36:4\tHe deviseth iniquity upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil. Psalm 36:5\tThy lovingkindness, O LORD, is in the heavens; thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies. Psalm 36:6\tThy righteousness is like the mountains of God; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast. Psalm 36:7\tHow precious is thy lovingkindness, O God! and the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings. Psalm 36:8\tThey shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. Psalm 36:9\tFor with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light. Psalm 36:10\tO continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. Psalm 36:11\tLet not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. Psalm 36:12\tThere are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise. Psalm 37:1\tA Psalm of David. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness. Psalm 37:2\tFor they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. Psalm 37:3\tTrust in the LORD, and do good; dwell in the land, and follow after faithfulness. Psalm 37:4\tDelight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Psalm 37:5\tCommit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass. Psalm 37:6\tAdd he shall make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. Psalm 37:7\tRest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Psalm 37:8\tCease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing. Psalm 37:9\tFor evil-doers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the land. Psalm 37:10\tFor yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be. Psalm 37:11\tBut the meek shall inherit the land; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. Psalm 37:12\tThe wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. Psalm 37:13\tThe Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming. Psalm 37:14\tThe wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow; to cast down the poor and needy, to slay such as be upright in the way: Psalm 37:15\tTheir sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. Psalm 37:16\tBetter is a little that the righteous hath than the abundance of many wicked. Psalm 37:17\tFor the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous. Psalm 37:18\tThe LORD knoweth the days of the perfect: and their inheritance shall be for ever. Psalm 37:19\tThey shall not be ashamed in the time of evil: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. Psalm 37:20\tBut the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the excellency of the pastures: they shall consume; in smoke shall they consume away. Psalm 37:21\tThe wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth. Psalm 37:22\tFor such as be blessed of him shall inherit the land; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off. Psalm 37:23\tA man’s goings are established of the LORD; and he delighteth in his way. Psalm 37:24\tThough he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand. Psalm 37:25\tI have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread. Psalm 37:26\tAll the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed. Psalm 37:27\tDepart from evil, and do good; dwell for evermore. Psalm 37:28\tFor the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. Psalm 37:29\tThe righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever. Psalm 37:30\tThe mouth of the righteous talketh of wisdom, and his tongue speaketh judgment. Psalm 37:31\tThe law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide. Psalm 37:32\tThe wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. Psalm 37:33\tThe LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. Psalm 37:34\tWait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. Psalm 37:35\tI have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil. Psalm 37:36\tBut one passed by, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. Psalm 37:37\tMark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the latter end of that man is peace. Psalm 37:38\tAs for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together: the latter end of the wicked shall be cut off. Psalm 37:39\tBut the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strong hold in the time of trouble. Psalm 37:40\tAnd the LORD helpeth them, and rescueth them: he rescueth them from the wicked, and saveth them, because they have taken refuge in him. Psalm 38:1\tA Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. Psalm 38:2\tFor thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. Psalm 38:3\tThere is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation; neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin. Psalm 38:4\tFor mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. Psalm 38:5\tMy wounds stink and are corrupt, because of my foolishness. Psalm 38:6\tI am pained and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. Psalm 38:7\tFor my loins are filled with burning; and there is no soundness in my flesh. Psalm 38:8\tI am faint and sore bruised: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. Psalm 38:9\tLord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. Psalm 38:10\tMy heart throbbeth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. Psalm 38:11\tMy lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; and my kinsmen stand afar off. Psalm 38:12\tThey also that seek after my life lay snares for me; and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long. Psalm 38:13\tBut I, as a deaf man, hear not; and I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. Psalm 38:14\tYea, I am as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. Psalm 38:15\tFor in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt answer, O Lord my God. Psalm 38:16\tFor I said, Lest they rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. Psalm 38:17\tFor I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me. Psalm 38:18\tFor I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. Psalm 38:19\tBut mine enemies are lively, and are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. Psalm 38:20\tThey also that render evil for good are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good. Psalm 38:21\tForsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me. Psalm 38:22\tMake haste to help me, O Lord my salvation. Psalm 39:1\tFor the Chief Musician, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. Psalm 39:2\tI was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred. Psalm 39:3\tMy heart was hot within me; while I was musing the fire kindled: then spake I with my tongue: Psalm 39:4\tLORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; let me know how frail I am. Psalm 39:5\tBehold, thou hast made my days as handbreadths; and mine age is as nothing before thee: surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah Psalm 39:6\tSurely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them. Psalm 39:7\tAnd now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee. Psalm 39:8\tDeliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish. Psalm 39:9\tI was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it. Psalm 39:10\tRemove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand. Psalm 39:11\tWhen thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah Psalm 39:12\tHear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, a sojourner, as all my fathers were. Psalm 39:13\tO spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more. Psalm 40:1\tFor the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. Psalm 40:2\tHe brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay; and he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. Psalm 40:3\tAnd he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD. Psalm 40:4\tBlessed is the man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. Psalm 40:5\tMany, O LORD my God, are the wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be set in order unto thee; if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered. Psalm 40:6\tSacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Psalm 40:7\tThen said I, Lo, I am come; in the roll of the book it is written of me: Psalm 40:8\tI delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart. Psalm 40:9\tI have published righteousness in the great congregation; lo, I will not refrain my lips, O LORD, thou knowest. Psalm 40:10\tI have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation. Psalm 40:11\tWithhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me. Psalm 40:12\tFor innumerable evils have compassed me about, mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head, and my heart hath failed me. Psalm 40:13\tBe pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: make haste to help me, O LORD. Psalm 40:14\tLet them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it: let them be turned backward and brought to dishonour that delight in my hurt. Psalm 40:15\tLet them be desolate by reason of their shame that say unto me, Aha, Aha. Psalm 40:16\tLet all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified. Psalm 40:17\tBut I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God. Psalm 41:1\tFor the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in the day of evil. Psalm 41:2\tThe LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the earth; and deliver not thou him unto the will of his enemies. Psalm 41:3\tThe LORD will support him upon the couch of languishing: thou makest all his bed in his sickness. Psalm 41:4\tI said, O LORD, have mercy upon me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. Psalm 41:5\tMine enemies speak evil against me, saying, When shall he die, and his name perish? Psalm 41:6\tAnd if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity; his heart gathereth iniquity to itself: when he goeth abroad, he telleth it. Psalm 41:7\tAll that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt. Psalm 41:8\tAn evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more. Psalm 41:9\tYea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. Psalm 41:10\tBut thou, O LORD, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. Psalm 41:11\tBy this I know that thou delightest in me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. Psalm 41:12\tAnd as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever. Psalm 41:13\tBlessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. Psalm 42:1\tBOOK II For the Chief Musician; Maschil of the sons of Korah. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. Psalm 42:2\tMy soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? Psalm 42:3\tMy tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? Psalm 42:4\tThese things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I went with the throng, and led them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday. Psalm 42:5\tWhy art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the health of his countenance. Psalm 42:6\tO my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore do I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and the Hermons, from the hill Mizar. Psalm 42:7\tDeep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. Psalm 42:8\tYet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day-time, and in the night his song shall be with me, even a prayer unto the God of my life. Psalm 42:9\tI will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? Psalm 42:10\tAs with a sword in my bones, mine adversaries reproach me; while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? Psalm 42:11\tWhy art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. Psalm 43:1\tJudge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. Psalm 43:2\tFor thou art the God of my strength; why hast thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? Psalm 43:3\tO send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me: let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles. Psalm 43:4\tThen will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: and upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God. Psalm 43:5\tWhy art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. Psalm 44:1\tFor the Chief Musician; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the days of old. Psalm 44:2\tThou didst drive out the nations with thy hand, and plantedst them in; thou didst afflict the peoples, and didst spread them abroad. Psalm 44:3\tFor they gat not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them. Psalm 44:4\tThou art my King, O God: command deliverance for Jacob. Psalm 44:5\tThrough thee will we push down our adversaries: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us. Psalm 44:6\tFor I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. Psalm 44:7\tBut thou hast saved us from our adversaries, and hast put them to shame that hate us. Psalm 44:8\tIn God have we made our boast all the day long, and we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. Selah Psalm 44:9\tBut now thou hast cast us off, and brought us to dishonour; and goest not forth with our hosts. Psalm 44:10\tThou makest us to turn back from the adversary: and they which hate us spoil for themselves. Psalm 44:11\tThou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the nations. Psalm 44:12\tThou sellest thy people for nought, and hast not increased thy wealth by their price. Psalm 44:13\tThou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. Psalm 44:14\tThou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples. Psalm 44:15\tAll the day long is my dishonour before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, Psalm 44:16\tFor the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and the avenger. Psalm 44:17\tAll this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. Psalm 44:18\tOur heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; Psalm 44:19\tThat thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death. Psalm 44:20\tIf we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god; Psalm 44:21\tShall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. Psalm 44:22\tYea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Psalm 44:23\tAwake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever. Psalm 44:24\tWherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression? Psalm 44:25\tFor our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth. Psalm 44:26\tRise up for our help, and redeem us for thy lovingkindness’ sake. Psalm 45:1\tFor the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves. My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter: I speak the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. Psalm 45:2\tThou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. Psalm 45:3\tGird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, thy glory and thy majesty. Psalm 45:4\tAnd in thy majesty ride on prosperously, because of truth and meekness and righteousness: and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. Psalm 45:5\tThine arrows are sharp; the peoples fall under thee; they are in the heart of the king’s enemies. Psalm 45:6\tThy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Psalm 45:7\tThou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. Psalm 45:8\tAll thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia; out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad. Psalm 45:9\tKings’ daughters are among thy honourable women: at thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir. Psalm 45:10\tHearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house; Psalm 45:11\tSo shall the king desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him. Psalm 45:12\tAnd the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favour. Psalm 45:13\tThe king’s daughter within the palace is all glorious: her clothing is inwrought with gold. Psalm 45:14\tShe shall be led unto the king in broidered work: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. Psalm 45:15\tWith gladness and rejoicing shall they be led: they shall enter into the king’s palace. Psalm 45:16\tInstead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth. Psalm 45:17\tI will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the peoples give thee thanks for ever and ever. Psalm 46:1\tFor the Chief Musician: a Psalm of the sons of Korah; set to Alamoth. A Song. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Psalm 46:2\tTherefore will we not fear, though the earth do change, and though the mountains be moved in the heart of the seas; Psalm 46:3\tThough the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah Psalm 46:4\tThere is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High. Psalm 46:5\tGod is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early. Psalm 46:6\tThe nations raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. Psalm 46:7\tThe LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah Psalm 46:8\tCome, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. Psalm 46:9\tHe maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariots in the fire. Psalm 46:10\tBe still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. Psalm 46:11\tThe LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.

Psalm 48:3\tGod hath made himself known in her palaces for a refuge. Psalm 48:4\tFor, lo, the kings assembled themselves, they passed by together. Psalm 48:5\tThey saw it, then were they amazed; they were dismayed, they hasted away. Psalm 48:6\tTrembling took hold of them there; pain, as of a woman in travail. Psalm 48:7\tWith the east wind thou breakest the ships of Tarshish. Psalm 48:8\tAs we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.

Hear this, all ye peoples; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: Psalm 49:2\tBoth low and high, rich and poor together. Psalm 49:3\tMy mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. Psalm 49:4\tI will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp. Psalm 49:5\tWherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when iniquity at my heels compasseth me about? Psalm 49:6\tThey that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; Psalm 49:7\tNone of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: Psalm 49:8\t(For the redemption of their soul is costly, and must be let alone for ever:) Psalm 49:9\tThat he should still live alway, that he should not see corruption. Psalm 49:10\tFor he seeth that wise men die, the fool and the brutish together perish, and leave their wealth to others. Psalm 49:11\tTheir inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names. Psalm 49:12\tBut man abideth not in honour: he is like the beasts that perish. Psalm 49:13\tThis their way is their folly: yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah Psalm 49:14\tThey are appointed as a flock for Sheol; death shall be their shepherd: and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, that there be no habitation for it. Psalm 49:15\tBut God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol: for he shall receive me. Selah Psalm 49:16\tBe not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased: Psalm 49:17\tFor when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him. Psalm 49:18\tThough while he lived he blessed his soul, and men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself, Psalm 49:19\tHe shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see the light. Psalm 49:20\tMan that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish. Psalm 50:1\tA Psalm of Asaph. God, even God, the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. Psalm 50:2\tOut of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth.

Psalm 50:4\tHe shall call to the heavens above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people: Psalm 50:5\tGather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.

Selah Psalm 50:7\tHear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify unto thee: I am God, even thy God. Psalm 50:8\tI will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; and thy burnt offerings are continually before me. Psalm 50:9\tI will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy folds.

Psalm 50:12\tIf I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof. Psalm 50:13\tWill I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Psalm 50:14\tOffer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the Most High: Psalm 50:15\tAnd call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. Psalm 50:16\tBut unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes; and that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth? Psalm 50:17\tSeeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee. Psalm 50:18\tWhen thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. Psalm 50:19\tThou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. Psalm 50:20\tThou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son. Psalm 50:21\tThese things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. Psalm 50:22\tNow consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver: Psalm 50:23\tWhoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifieth me; and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God. Psalm 51:1\tFor the Chief Musician. A psalm of David: when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness; according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Psalm 51:2\tWash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. Psalm 51:3\tFor I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Psalm 51:4\tAgainst thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in thy sight: that thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.

Psalm 51:9\tHide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. Psalm 51:10\tCreate in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Psalm 51:11\tCast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. Psalm 51:12\tRestore unto me the joy of thy salvation: and uphold me with a free spirit. Psalm 51:13\tThen will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee. Psalm 51:14\tDeliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation; and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. Psalm 51:15\tO Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. Psalm 51:16\tFor thou delightest not in sacrifice; else would I give it: thou hast no pleasure in burnt offering. Psalm 51:17\tThe sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. Psalm 51:18\tDo good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. Psalm 51:19\tThen shalt thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar. Psalm 52:1\tFor the Chief Musician. Maschil of David: when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech. Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the mercy of God endureth continually. Psalm 52:2\tThy tongue deviseth very wickedness; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. Psalm 52:3\tThou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah Psalm 52:4\tThou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue. Psalm 52:5\tGod shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah Psalm 52:6\tThe righteous also shall see it, and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying, Psalm 52:7\tLo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness. Psalm 52:8\tBut as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. Psalm 52:9\tI will give thee thanks for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name, for it is good, in the presence of thy saints. Psalm 53:1\tFor the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath. Maschil of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; there is none that doeth good. Psalm 53:2\tGod looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek after God. Psalm 53:3\tEvery one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Psalm 53:4\tHave the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon God. Psalm 53:5\tThere were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee; thou hast put them to shame, because God hath rejected them. Psalm 53:6\tOh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

Psalm 54:3\tFor strangers are risen up against me, and violent men have sought after my soul: they have not set God before them.

Psalm 55:2\tAttend unto me, and answer me: I am restless in my complaint, and moan; Psalm 55:3\tBecause of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked; for they cast iniquity upon me, and in anger they persecute me. Psalm 55:4\tMy heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. Psalm 55:5\tFearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. Psalm 55:6\tAnd I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! then would I fly away, and be at rest. Psalm 55:7\tLo, then would I wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah Psalm 55:8\tI would haste me to a shelter from the stormy wind and tempest. Psalm 55:9\tDestroy, O Lord, and divide their tongue: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. Psalm 55:10\tDay and night they go about upon the walls thereof: iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it. Psalm 55:11\tWickedness is in the midst thereof: oppression and guile depart not from her streets. Psalm 55:12\tFor it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him: Psalm 55:13\tBut it was thou, a man mine equal, my companion, and my familiar friend. Psalm 55:14\tWe took sweet counsel together, we walked in the house of God with the throng. Psalm 55:15\tLet death come suddenly upon them, let them go down alive into the pit: for wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them. Psalm 55:16\tAs for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me. Psalm 55:17\tEvening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain, and moan: and he shall hear my voice. Psalm 55:18\tHe hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for they were many that strove with me. Psalm 55:19\tGod shall hear, and answer them, even he that abideth of old, Selah the men who have no changes, and who fear not God. Psalm 55:20\tHe hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him: he hath profaned his covenant. Psalm 55:21\tHis mouth was smooth as butter, but his heart was war: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. Psalm 55:22\tCast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. Psalm 55:23\tBut thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.

Psalm 56:4\tIn God I will praise his word: in God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; what can flesh do unto me? Psalm 56:5\tAll the day long they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil. Psalm 56:6\tThey gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, even as they have waited for my soul. Psalm 56:7\tShall they escape by iniquity? in anger cast down the peoples, O God. Psalm 56:8\tThou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle; are they not in thy book?

Psalm 57:2\tI will cry unto God Most High; unto God that performeth all things for me. Psalm 57:3\tHe shall send from heaven, and save me, when he that would swallow me up reproacheth; Selah God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. Psalm 57:4\tMy soul is among lions; I lie among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. Psalm 57:5\tBe thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.

Psalm 58:2\tYea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth. Psalm 58:3\tThe wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. Psalm 58:4\tTheir poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; Psalm 58:5\tWhich hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. Psalm 58:6\tBreak their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD. Psalm 58:7\tLet them melt away as water that runneth apace: when he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.

Psalm 59:7\tBehold, they belch out with their mouth; swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?

Psalm 64:5\tThey encourage themselves in an evil purpose; they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

A Psalm of David. Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul. Psalm 69:2\tI sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. Psalm 69:3\tI am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. Psalm 69:4\tThey that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away. Psalm 69:5\tO God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee. Psalm 69:6\tLet not them that wait on thee be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of hosts: let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonour through me, O God of Israel. Psalm 69:7\tBecause for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. Psalm 69:8\tI am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children. Psalm 69:9\tFor the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me. Psalm 69:10\tWhen I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach. Psalm 69:11\tWhen I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a proverb unto them. Psalm 69:12\tThey that sit in the gate talk of me; and I am the song of the drunkards. Psalm 69:13\tBut as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy, answer me in the truth of thy salvation. Psalm 69:14\tDeliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

Psalm 69:19\tThou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee. Psalm 69:20\tReproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. Psalm 69:21\tThey gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. Psalm 69:22\tLet their table before them become a snare; and when they are in peace, let it become a trap. Psalm 69:23\tLet their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake. Psalm 69:24\tPour out thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them. Psalm 69:25\tLet their habitation be desolate; let none dwell in their tents. Psalm 69:26\tFor they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded, Psalm 69:27\tAdd iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness. Psalm 69:28\tLet them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous. Psalm 69:29\tBut I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. Psalm 69:30\tI will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. Psalm 69:31\tAnd it shall please the LORD better than an ox, or a bullock that hath horns and hoofs. Psalm 69:32\tThe meek have seen it, and are glad: ye that seek after God, let your heart live. Psalm 69:33\tFor the LORD heareth the needy, and despiseth not his prisoners. Psalm 69:34\tLet heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. Psalm 69:35\tFor God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; and they shall abide there, and have it in possession.

Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.

Psalm 71:2\tDeliver me in thy righteousness, and rescue me: bow down thine ear unto me, and save me. Psalm 71:3\tBe thou to me a rock of habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress. Psalm 71:4\tRescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. Psalm 71:5\tFor thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth. Psalm 71:6\tBy thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee. Psalm 71:7\tI am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge. Psalm 71:8\tMy mouth shall be filled with thy praise, and with thy honour all the day. Psalm 71:9\tCast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth. Psalm 71:10\tFor mine enemies speak concerning me; and they that watch for my soul take counsel together, Psalm 71:11\tSaying, God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver. Psalm 71:12\tO God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste to help me. Psalm 71:13\tLet them be ashamed and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt. Psalm 71:14\tBut I will hope continually, and will praise thee yet more and more. Psalm 71:15\tMy mouth shall tell of thy righteousness, and of thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof. Psalm 71:16\tI will come with the mighty acts of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only. Psalm 71:17\tO God, thou hast taught me from my youth; and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. Psalm 71:18\tYea, even when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have declared thy strength unto the next generation, thy might to every one that is to come. Psalm 71:19\tThy righteousness also, O God, is very high; thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto thee? Psalm 71:20\tThou, which hast shewed us many and sore troubles, shalt quicken us again, and shalt bring us up again from the depths of the earth. Psalm 71:21\tIncrease thou my greatness, and turn again and comfort me. Psalm 71:22\tI will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing praises with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. Psalm 71:23\tMy lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing praises unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed. Psalm 71:24\tMy tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are ashamed, for they are confounded, that seek my hurt. Psalm 72:1\tA Psalm of Solomon.

Psalm 72:5\tThey shall fear thee while the sun endureth, and so long as the moon, throughout all generations.

Amen, and Amen. Psalm 72:20\tThe prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended. Psalm 73:1\tBOOK III A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart. Psalm 73:2\tBut as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. Psalm 73:3\tFor I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. Psalm 73:4\tFor there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm. Psalm 73:5\tThey are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men. Psalm 73:6\tTherefore pride is as a chain about their neck; violence covereth them as a garment. Psalm 73:7\tTheir eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. Psalm 73:8\tThey scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: they speak loftily. Psalm 73:9\tThey have set their mouth in the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. Psalm 73:10\tTherefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out by them. Psalm 73:11\tAnd they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High? Psalm 73:12\tBehold, these are the wicked; and, being alway at ease, they increase in riches. Psalm 73:13\tSurely in vain have I cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocency; Psalm 73:14\tFor all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. Psalm 73:15\tIf I had said, I will speak thus; behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children. Psalm 73:16\tWhen I thought how I might know this, it was too painful for me; Psalm 73:17\tUntil I went into the sanctuary of God, and considered their latter end. Psalm 73:18\tSurely thou settest them in slippery places: thou castest them down to destruction. Psalm 73:19\tHow are they become a desolation in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. Psalm 73:20\tAs a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. Psalm 73:21\tFor my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins: Psalm 73:22\tSo brutish was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee. Psalm 73:23\tNevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden my right hand. Psalm 73:24\tThou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. Psalm 73:25\tWhom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. Psalm 73:26\tMy flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever. Psalm 73:27\tFor, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. Psalm 73:28\tBut it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all thy works. Psalm 74:1\tMaschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? Psalm 74:2\tRemember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old, which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance; and mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. Psalm 74:3\tLift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary. Psalm 74:4\tThine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly; they have set up their ensigns for signs. Psalm 74:5\tThey seemed as men that lifted up axes upon a thicket of trees. Psalm 74:6\tAnd now all the carved work thereof together they break down with hatchet and hammers. Psalm 74:7\tThey have set thy sanctuary on fire; they have profaned the dwelling place of thy name even to the ground. Psalm 74:8\tThey said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. Psalm 74:9\tWe see not our signs: there is no more any prophet; neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. Psalm 74:10\tHow long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? Psalm 74:11\tWhy drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom and consume them. Psalm 74:12\tYet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. Psalm 74:13\tThou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. Psalm 74:14\tThou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, thou gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. Psalm 74:15\tThou didst cleave fountain and flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. Psalm 74:16\tThe day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. Psalm 74:17\tThou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. Psalm 74:18\tRemember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that foolish people have blasphemed thy name. Psalm 74:19\tO deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast: forget not the life of thy poor for ever. Psalm 74:20\tHave respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence. Psalm 74:21\tO let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. Psalm 74:22\tArise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day. Psalm 74:23\tForget not the voice of thine adversaries: the tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually. Psalm 75:1\tFor the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song. We give thanks unto thee, O God; we give thanks, for thy name is near: men tell of thy wondrous works. Psalm 75:2\tWhen I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly. Psalm 75:3\tThe earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. Selah Psalm 75:4\tI said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: Psalm 75:5\tLift not up your horn on high; speak not with a stiff neck. Psalm 75:6\tFor neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, cometh lifting up. Psalm 75:7\tBut God is the judge: he putteth down one, and lifteth up another. Psalm 75:8\tFor in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine foameth; it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. Psalm 75:9\tBut I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. Psalm 75:10\tAll the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. Psalm 76:1\tFor the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song. In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel. Psalm 76:2\tIn Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. Psalm 76:3\tThere he brake the arrows of the bow; the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah Psalm 76:4\tGlorious art thou and excellent, from the mountains of prey. Psalm 76:5\tThe stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands. Psalm 76:6\tAt thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. Psalm 76:7\tThou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? Psalm 76:8\tThou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, Psalm 76:9\tWhen God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah Psalm 76:10\tSurely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee. Psalm 76:11\tVow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. Psalm 76:12\tHe shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth. Psalm 77:1\tFor the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I will cry unto God with my voice; even unto God with my voice, and he wilt give ear unto me. Psalm 77:2\tIn the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; my soul refused to be comforted. Psalm 77:3\tI remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah Psalm 77:4\tThou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. Psalm 77:5\tI have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. Psalm 77:6\tI call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart; and my spirit made diligent search. Psalm 77:7\tWill the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? Psalm 77:8\tIs his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? Psalm 77:9\tHath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah Psalm 77:10\tAnd I said, This is my infirmity; but I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High. Psalm 77:11\tI will make mention of the deeds of the LORD; for I will remember thy wonders of old. Psalm 77:12\tI will meditate also upon all thy work, and muse on thy doings. Psalm 77:13\tThy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is a great god like unto God? Psalm 77:14\tThou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples. Psalm 77:15\tThou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah Psalm 77:16\tThe waters saw thee, O God; the waters saw thee, they were afraid: the depths also trembled. Psalm 77:17\tThe clouds poured out water; the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. Psalm 77:18\tThe voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. Psalm 77:19\tThy way was in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters, and thy footsteps were not known. Psalm 77:20\tThou leddest thy people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron. Psalm 78:1\tMaschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law; incline your ears to the words of my mouth. Psalm 78:2\tI will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old: Psalm 78:3\tWhich we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. Psalm 78:4\tWe will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done. Psalm 78:5\tFor he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: Psalm 78:6\tThat the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and tell them to their children: Psalm 78:7\tThat they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: Psalm 78:8\tAnd might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. Psalm 78:9\tThe children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. Psalm 78:10\tThey kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; Psalm 78:11\tAnd they forgat his doings, and his wondrous works that he had shewed them. Psalm 78:12\tMarvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. Psalm 78:13\tHe clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. Psalm 78:14\tIn the day-time also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. Psalm 78:15\tHe clave rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. Psalm 78:16\tHe brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. Psalm 78:17\tYet went they on still to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert. Psalm 78:18\tAnd they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. Psalm 78:19\tYea, they spake against God; they said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? Psalm 78:20\tBehold, he smote the rock, that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; can he give bread also? will he provide flesh for his people? Psalm 78:21\tTherefore the LORD heard, and was wroth: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel; Psalm 78:22\tBecause they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation. Psalm 78:23\tYet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven; Psalm 78:24\tAnd he rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave them of the corn of heaven. Psalm 78:25\tMan did eat the bread of the mighty: he sent them meat to the full. Psalm 78:26\tHe caused the east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he guided the south wind. Psalm 78:27\tHe rained flesh also upon them as the dust, and winged fowl as the sand of the seas: Psalm 78:28\tAnd he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. Psalm 78:29\tSo they did eat, and were well filled; and he gave them that they lusted after. Psalm 78:30\tThey were not estranged from their lust, their meat was yet in their mouths, Psalm 78:31\tWhen the anger of God went up against them, and slew of the fattest of them, and smote down the young men of Israel. Psalm 78:32\tFor all this they sinned still, and believed not in his wondrous works. Psalm 78:33\tTherefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in terror. Psalm 78:34\tWhen he slew them, then they inquired after him: and they returned and sought God early. Psalm 78:35\tAnd they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God their redeemer. Psalm 78:36\tBut they flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue. Psalm 78:37\tFor their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant. Psalm 78:38\tBut he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. Psalm 78:39\tAnd he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. Psalm 78:40\tHow oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! Psalm 78:41\tAnd they turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. Psalm 78:42\tThey remembered not his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary. Psalm 78:43\tHow he set his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan; Psalm 78:44\tAnd turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, that they could not drink. Psalm 78:45\tHe sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. Psalm 78:46\tHe gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. Psalm 78:47\tHe destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. Psalm 78:48\tHe gave over their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. Psalm 78:49\tHe cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a band of angels of evil. Psalm 78:50\tHe made a path for his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; Psalm 78:51\tAnd smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham: Psalm 78:52\tBut he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. Psalm 78:53\tAnd he led them safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. Psalm 78:54\tAnd he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. Psalm 78:55\tHe drove out the nations also before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. Psalm 78:56\tYet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and kept not his testimonies; Psalm 78:57\tBut turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. Psalm 78:58\tFor they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. Psalm 78:59\tWhen God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: Psalm 78:60\tSo that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; Psalm 78:61\tAnd delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the adversary’s hand. Psalm 78:62\tHe gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. Psalm 78:63\tFire devoured their young men; and their maidens had no marriage-song. Psalm 78:64\tTheir priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. Psalm 78:65\tThen the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. Psalm 78:66\tAnd he smote his adversaries backward: he put them to a perpetual reproach. Psalm 78:67\tMoreover he refused the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; Psalm 78:68\tBut chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. Psalm 78:69\tAnd he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath established for ever. Psalm 78:70\tHe chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: Psalm 78:71\tFrom following the ewes that give suck he brought him, to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. Psalm 78:72\tSo he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. Psalm 79:1\tA Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. Psalm 79:2\tThe dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. Psalm 79:3\tTheir blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them. Psalm 79:4\tWe are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. Psalm 79:5\tHow long, O LORD, wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? Psalm 79:6\tPour out thy wrath upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name. Psalm 79:7\tFor they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation. Psalm 79:8\tRemember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. Psalm 79:9\tHelp us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake. Psalm 79:10\tWherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed be known among the heathen in our sight. Psalm 79:11\tLet the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death; Psalm 79:12\tAnd render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. Psalm 79:13\tSo we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations. Psalm 80:1\tFor the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that sittest upon the cherubim, shine forth. Psalm 80:2\tBefore Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might, and come to save us. Psalm 80:3\tTurn us again, O God; and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. Psalm 80:4\tO LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? Psalm 80:5\tThou hast fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure. Psalm 80:6\tThou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. Psalm 80:7\tTurn us again, O God of hosts; and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. Psalm 80:8\tThou broughtest a vine out of Egypt: thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it. Psalm 80:9\tThou preparedst room before it, and it took deep root, and filled the land. Psalm 80:10\tThe mountains were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like cedars of God. Psalm 80:11\tShe sent out her branches unto the sea, and her shoots unto the River. Psalm 80:12\tWhy hast thou broken down her fences, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? Psalm 80:13\tThe boar out of the wood doth ravage it, and the wild beasts of the field feed on it. Psalm 80:14\tTurn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine, Psalm 80:15\tAnd the stock which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. Psalm 80:16\tIt is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. Psalm 80:17\tLet thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. Psalm 80:18\tSo shall we not go back from thee: quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name, Psalm 80:19\tTurn us again, O LORD God of hosts; cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved; Psalm 81:1\tFor the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of Asaph. Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. Psalm 81:2\tTake up the psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. Psalm 81:3\tBlow up the trumpet in the new moon, at the full moon, on our solemn feast day. Psalm 81:4\tFor it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. Psalm 81:5\tHe appointed it in Joseph for testimony, when he went out over the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I knew not. Psalm 81:6\tI removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were freed from the basket. Psalm 81:7\tThou calledst in trouble, and I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah Psalm 81:8\tHear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me! Psalm 81:9\tThere shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. Psalm 81:10\tI am the LORD thy God, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. Psalm 81:11\tBut my people hearkened not to my voice; and Israel would none of me. Psalm 81:12\tSo I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, that they might walk in their own counsels. Psalm 81:13\tOh that my people would hearken unto me, that Israel would walk in my ways! Psalm 81:14\tI should soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries. Psalm 81:15\tThe haters of the LORD should submit themselves unto him: but their time should endure for ever. Psalm 81:16\tHe should feed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I satisfy thee. Psalm 82:1\tA Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the congregation of God; he judgeth among the gods. Psalm 82:2\tHow long will ye judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the wicked? Selah Psalm 82:3\tJudge the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and destitute. Psalm 82:4\tRescue the poor and needy: deliver them out of the hand of the wicked. Psalm 82:5\tThey know not, neither do they understand; they walk to and fro in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are moved. Psalm 82:6\tI said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High. Psalm 82:7\tNevertheless ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. Psalm 82:8\tArise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all the nations. Psalm 83:1\tA Song, a Psalm of Asaph. O God, keep not thou silence: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. Psalm 83:2\tFor, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. Psalm 83:3\tThey take crafty counsel against thy people, and consult together against thy hidden ones. Psalm 83:4\tThey have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. Psalm 83:5\tFor they have consulted together with one consent; against thee do they make a covenant: Psalm 83:6\tThe tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagarenes; Psalm 83:7\tGebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre: Psalm 83:8\tAssyria also is joined with them; they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah Psalm 83:9\tDo thou unto them as unto Midian; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon: Psalm 83:10\tWhich perished at En-dor; they became as dung for the earth. Psalm 83:11\tMake their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna: Psalm 83:12\tWho said, Let us take to ourselves in possession the habitations of God. Psalm 83:13\tO my God, make them like the whirling dust; as stubble before the wind. Psalm 83:14\tAs the fire that burneth the forest, and as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire; Psalm 83:15\tSo pursue them with thy tempest, and terrify them with thy storm. Psalm 83:16\tFill their faces with confusion; that they may seek thy name, O LORD. Psalm 83:17\tLet them be ashamed and dismayed for ever; yea, let them be confounded and perish: Psalm 83:18\tThat they may know that thou alone, whose name is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth. Psalm 84:1\tFor the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! Psalm 84:2\tMy soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out unto the living God. Psalm 84:3\tYea, the sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God. Psalm 84:4\tBlessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah Psalm 84:5\tBlessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the highways to Zion. Psalm 84:6\tPassing through the valley of Weeping they make it a place of springs; yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings. Psalm 84:7\tThey go from strength to strength, every one of them appeareth before God in Zion. Psalm 84:8\tO LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah Psalm 84:9\tBehold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. Psalm 84:10\tFor a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. Psalm 84:11\tFor the LORD God is a sun and a shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. Psalm 84:12\tO LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee. Psalm 85:1\tFor the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. LORD, Thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. Psalm 85:2\tThou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah Psalm 85:3\tThou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger. Psalm 85:4\tTurn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine indignation toward us to cease. Psalm 85:5\tWilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? Psalm 85:6\tWilt thou not quicken us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee? Psalm 85:7\tShew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation. Psalm 85:8\tI will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. Psalm 85:9\tSurely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. Psalm 85:10\tMercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Psalm 85:11\tTruth springeth out of the earth; and righteousness hath looked clown from heaven. Psalm 85:12\tYea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase. Psalm 85:13\tRighteousness shall go before him; and shall make his footsteps a way to walk in. Psalm 86:1\tA Prayer Of David. Bow down thine ear, O LORD, and answer me; for I am poor and needy. Psalm 86:2\tPreserve my soul; for I am godly: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. Psalm 86:3\tBe merciful unto me, O Lord; for unto thee do I cry all the day long. Psalm 86:4\tRejoice the soul of thy servant; for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. Psalm 86:5\tFor thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. Psalm 86:6\tGive ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and hearken unto the voice of my supplications. Psalm 86:7\tIn the day of my trouble I will call upon thee; for thou wilt answer me. Psalm 86:8\tThere is none like unto thee among the gods, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. Psalm 86:9\tAll nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and they shall glorify thy name. Psalm 86:10\tFor thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone. Psalm 86:11\tTeach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. Psalm 86:12\tI will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart; and I will glorify thy name for evermore. Psalm 86:13\tFor great is thy mercy toward me; and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest pit. Psalm 86:14\tO God, the proud are risen up against me, and the congregation of violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set thee before them. Psalm 86:15\tBut thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy and truth. Psalm 86:16\tO turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. Psalm 86:17\tShew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed, because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me, Psalm 87:1\tA Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains. Psalm 87:2\tThe LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Psalm 87:3\tGlorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah Psalm 87:4\tI will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this one was born there. Psalm 87:5\tYea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her; and the Most High himself shall establish her. Psalm 87:6\tThe LORD shall count, when he writeth up the peoples, this one was born there. Selah Psalm 87:7\tThey that sing as well as they that dance shall say, All my fountains are in thee. Psalm 88:1\tA Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. O LORD, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: Psalm 88:2\tLet my prayer enter into thy presence; incline thine ear unto my cry: Psalm 88:3\tFor my soul is full of troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto Sheol. Psalm 88:4\tI am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am as a man that hath no help: Psalm 88:5\tCast off among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more; and they are cut off from thy hand. Psalm 88:6\tThou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places, in the deeps. Psalm 88:7\tThy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah Psalm 88:8\tThou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. Psalm 88:9\tMine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction: I have called daily upon thee, O LORD, I have spread forth my hands unto thee. Psalm 88:10\tWilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall they that are deceased arise and praise thee? Selah Psalm 88:11\tShall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in Destruction? Psalm 88:12\tShall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? Psalm 88:13\tBut unto thee, O LORD, have I cried, and in the morning shall my prayer come before thee. Psalm 88:14\tLORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me? Psalm 88:15\tI am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted. Psalm 88:16\tThy fierce wrath is gone over me; thy terrors have cut me off. Psalm 88:17\tThey came round about me like water all the day long; they compassed me about together. Psalm 88:18\tLover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness. Psalm 89:1\tMaschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. Psalm 89:2\tFor I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever; thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. Psalm 89:3\tI have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant; Psalm 89:4\tThy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah Psalm 89:5\tAnd the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD; thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones. Psalm 89:6\tFor who in the skies can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty is like unto the LORD, Psalm 89:7\tA God very terrible in the council of the holy ones, and to be feared above all them that are round about him? Psalm 89:8\tO LORD God of hosts, who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O JAH? and thy faithfulness is round about thee. Psalm 89:9\tThou rulest the pride of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them. Psalm 89:10\tThou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength. Psalm 89:11\tThe heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. Psalm 89:12\tThe north and the south, thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name. Psalm 89:13\tThou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. Psalm 89:14\tRighteousness and judgment are the foundation of thy throne: mercy and truth go before thy face. Psalm 89:15\tBlessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance. Psalm 89:16\tIn thy name do they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness are they exalted. Psalm 89:17\tFor thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted. Psalm 89:18\tFor our shield belongeth unto the LORD; and our king to the Holy One of Israel. Psalm 89:19\tThen thou spakest in vision to thy saints, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people. Psalm 89:20\tI have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him: Psalm 89:21\tWith whom my hand shall be established; mine arm also shall strengthen him. Psalm 89:22\tThe enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him. Psalm 89:23\tAnd I will beat down his adversaries before him, and smite them that hate him. Psalm 89:24\tBut my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be exalted. Psalm 89:25\tI will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers. Psalm 89:26\tHe shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. Psalm 89:27\tI also will make him my firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. Psalm 89:28\tMy mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him. Psalm 89:29\tHis seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. Psalm 89:30\tIf his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; Psalm 89:31\tIf they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; Psalm 89:32\tThen will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Psalm 89:33\tBut my mercy will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. Psalm 89:34\tMy covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Psalm 89:35\tOnce have I sworn by my holiness; I will not lie unto David; Psalm 89:36\tHis seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. Psalm 89:37\tIt shall be established for ever as the moon, and as the faithful witness in the sky. Selah Psalm 89:38\tBut thou hast cast off and rejected, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. Psalm 89:39\tThou hast abhorred the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown even to the ground. Psalm 89:40\tThou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to rain. Psalm 89:41\tAll that pass by the way spoil him: he is become a reproach to his neighbours. Psalm 89:42\tThou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. Psalm 89:43\tYea, thou turnest back the edge his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle. Psalm 89:44\tThou hast made his brightness to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. Psalm 89:45\tThe days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah Psalm 89:46\tHow long, O LORD, wilt thou hid thyself for ever? how long shall thy wrath burn like fire? Psalm 89:47\tO remember how short my time is: for what vanity hast thou created all the children of men! Psalm 89:48\tWhat man is he that shall live and not see death, that shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah Psalm 89:49\tLord, where are thy former mercies, which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness? Psalm 89:50\tRemember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty peoples: Psalm 89:51\tWherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD, wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. Psalm 89:52\tBlessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen. Psalm 90:1\tBOOK IV A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. Psalm 90:2\tBefore the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. Psalm 90:3\tThou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. Psalm 90:4\tFor a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. Psalm 90:5\tThou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up. Psalm 90:6\tIn the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. Psalm 90:7\tFor we are consumed in thine anger, and in thy wrath are we troubled. Psalm 90:8\tThou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. Psalm 90:9\tFor all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we bring our years to an end as a tale that is told. Psalm 90:10\tThe days of our years are threescore years and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore years; yet is their pride but labour and sorrow; for it is soon gone, and we fly away. Psalm 90:11\tWho knoweth the power of thine anger, and thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee? Psalm 90:12\tSo teach us to number our days, that we may get us an heart of wisdom. Psalm 90:13\tReturn, O LORD; how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants. Psalm 90:14\tO satisfy us in the morning with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. Psalm 90:15\tMake us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. Psalm 90:16\tLet thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory upon their children. Psalm 90:17\tAnd let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. Psalm 91:1\tHe that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. Psalm 91:2\tI will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust. Psalm 91:3\tFor he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. Psalm 91:4\tHe shall cover thee with his pinions, and under his wings shalt thou take refuge: his truth is a shield and a buckler. Psalm 91:5\tThou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day; Psalm 91:6\tFor the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. Psalm 91:7\tA thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Psalm 91:8\tOnly with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the wicked. Psalm 91:9\tFor thou, O LORD, art my refuge! thou hast made the Most High thy habitation; Psalm 91:10\tThere shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent. Psalm 91:11\tFor he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. Psalm 91:12\tThey shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. Psalm 91:13\tThou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under feet. Psalm 91:14\tBecause he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. Psalm 91:15\tHe shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him, and honour him. Psalm 91:16\tWith long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. Psalm 92:1\tA Psalm, a Song for the sabbath day. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High: Psalm 92:2\tTo shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, Psalm 92:3\tWith an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; with a solemn sound upon the harp. Psalm 92:4\tFor thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. Psalm 92:5\tHow great are thy works, O LORD! thy thoughts are very deep. Psalm 92:6\tA brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this: Psalm 92:7\tWhen the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever: Psalm 92:8\tBut thou, O LORD, art on high for evermore. Psalm 92:9\tFor, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. Psalm 92:10\tBut my horn hast thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil. Psalm 92:11\tMine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies, mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me. Psalm 92:12\tThe righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Psalm 92:13\tThey that are planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God. Psalm 92:14\tThey shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and green: Psalm 92:15\tTo shew that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him. Psalm 93:1\tThe LORD reigneth; he is apparelled with majesty; the LORD is apparelled, he hath girded himself with strength: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. Psalm 93:2\tThy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. Psalm 93:3\tThe floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. Psalm 93:4\tAbove the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, the LORD on high is mighty. Psalm 93:5\tThy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for evermore. Psalm 94:1\tO LORD, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth. Psalm 94:2\tLift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render to the proud their desert. Psalm 94:3\tLORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? Psalm 94:4\tThey prate, they speak arrogantly: all the workers of iniquity boast themselves. Psalm 94:5\tThey break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage. Psalm 94:6\tThey slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. Psalm 94:7\tAnd they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob consider. Psalm 94:8\tConsider, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise? Psalm 94:9\tHe that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? Psalm 94:10\tHe that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct, even he that teacheth man knowledge? Psalm 94:11\tThe LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. Psalm 94:12\tBlessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest out of thy law; Psalm 94:13\tThat thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. Psalm 94:14\tFor the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. Psalm 94:15\tFor judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. Psalm 94:16\tWho will rise up for me against the evil-doers? who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? Psalm 94:17\tUnless the LORD had been my help, my soul had soon dwelt in silence. Psalm 94:18\tWhen I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up. Psalm 94:19\tIn the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. Psalm 94:20\tShall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by statute? Psalm 94:21\tThey gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. Psalm 94:22\tBut the LORD hath been my high tower; and my God the rock of my refuge. Psalm 94:23\tAnd he hath brought upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own evil; the LORD our God shall cut them off. Psalm 95:1\tO COME, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. Psalm 95:2\tLet us come before his presence with thanksgiving, let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. Psalm 95:3\tFor the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. Psalm 95:4\tIn his hand are the deep places of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also. Psalm 95:5\tThe sea is his, and he made it; and his hands formed the dry land. Psalm 95:6\tO come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD our Maker: Psalm 95:7\tFor he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, Oh that ye would hear his voice! Psalm 95:8\tHarden not your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness: Psalm 95:9\tWhen your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. Psalm 95:10\tForty years long was I grieved with that generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: Psalm 95:11\tWherefore I sware in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest. Psalm 96:1\tO SING unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth. Psalm 96:2\tSing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. Psalm 96:3\tDeclare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples. Psalm 96:4\tFor great is the LORD, and highly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. Psalm 96:5\tFor all the gods of the peoples are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. Psalm 96:6\tHonour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. Psalm 96:7\tGive unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples, give unto the LORD glory and strength. Psalm 96:8\tGive unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. Psalm 96:9\tO worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: tremble before him, all the earth. Psalm 96:10\tSay among the nations, The LORD reigneth: the world also is stablished that it cannot be moved: he shall judge the peoples with equity. Psalm 96:11\tLet the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Psalm 96:12\tLet the field exult, and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy; Psalm 96:13\tBefore the LORD, for he cometh; for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with his truth. Psalm 97:1\tThe LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad. Psalm 97:2\tClouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the foundation of his throne. Psalm 97:3\tA fire goeth before him, and burneth up his adversaries round about. Psalm 97:4\tHis lightnings lightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. Psalm 97:5\tThe hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth; Psalm 97:6\tThe heavens declare his righteousness, and all the peoples have seen his glory. Psalm 97:7\tAshamed be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods. Psalm 97:8\tZion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced; because of thy judgments, O LORD. Psalm 97:9\tFor thou, LORD, art most high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. Psalm 97:10\tO ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. Psalm 97:11\tLight is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. Psalm 97:12\tBe glad in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks to his holy name. Psalm 98:1\tA Psalm. Sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvelous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him. Psalm 98:2\tThe LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the nations. Psalm 98:3\tHe hath remembered his mercy and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. Psalm 98:4\tMake a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises. Psalm 98:5\tSing praises unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp and the voice of melody: Psalm 98:6\tWith trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the King, the LORD. Psalm 98:7\tLet the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein; Psalm 98:8\tLet the floods clap their hands; let the hills sing for joy together; Psalm 98:9\tBefore the LORD, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity. Psalm 99:1\tThe LORD reigneth; let the peoples tremble: he sitteth upon the cherubim; let the earth be moved. Psalm 99:2\tThe LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the peoples. Psalm 99:3\tLet them praise thy great and terrible name: holy is he. Psalm 99:4\tThe king’s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. Psalm 99:5\tExalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool: holy is he. Psalm 99:6\tMoses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call on his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. Psalm 99:7\tHe spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: they kept his testimonies, and the statute that he gave them. Psalm 99:8\tThou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their doings. Psalm 99:9\tExalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy. Psalm 100:1\tA Psalm of thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. Psalm 100:2\tServe the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing. Psalm 100:3\tKnow ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. Psalm 100:4\tEnter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: give thanks unto him, and bless his name. Psalm 100:5\tFor the LORD is good; his mercy endureth for ever; and his faithfulness unto all generations. Psalm 101:1\tA Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing praises. Psalm 101:2\tI will behave myself wisely in a perfect way: Oh when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. Psalm 101:3\tI will set no base thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave unto me. Psalm 101:4\tA froward heart shall depart from me: I will know no evil thing. Psalm 101:5\tWhoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I destroy: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will I not suffer. Psalm 101:6\tMine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me. Psalm 101:7\tHe that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes. Psalm 101:8\tMorning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the LORD. Psalm 102:1\tA Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee. Psalm 102:2\tHide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: incline thine ear unto me; in the day when I call answer me speedily. Psalm 102:3\tFor my days consume away like smoke, and my bones are burned as a firebrand. Psalm 102:4\tMy heart is smitten like grass, and withered; for I forget to eat my bread. Psalm 102:5\tBy reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my flesh. Psalm 102:6\tI am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places. Psalm 102:7\tI watch, and am become like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop. Psalm 102:8\tMine enemies reproach me all the day; they that are mad against me do curse by me. Psalm 102:9\tFor I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping. Psalm 102:10\tBecause of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and cast me away. Psalm 102:11\tMy days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass. Psalm 102:12\tBut thou, O LORD, shalt abide for ever; and thy memorial unto all generations. Psalm 102:13\tThou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for it is time to have pity upon her, yea, the set time is come. Psalm 102:14\tFor thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity upon her dust. Psalm 102:15\tSo the nations shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory: Psalm 102:16\tFor the LORD hath built up Zion, he hath appeared in his glory; Psalm 102:17\tHe hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, and hath not despised their prayer. Psalm 102:18\tThis shall be written for the generation to come: and a people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. Psalm 102:19\tFor he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; Psalm 102:20\tTo hear the sighing of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; Psalm 102:21\tThat men may declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; Psalm 102:22\tWhen the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. Psalm 102:23\tHe weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. Psalm 102:24\tI said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations. Psalm 102:25\tOf old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands. Psalm 102:26\tThey shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: Psalm 102:27\tBut thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. Psalm 102:28\tThe children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee. Psalm 103:1\tA Psalm of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Psalm 103:2\tBless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: Psalm 103:3\tWho forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; Psalm 103:4\tWho redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies: Psalm 103:5\tWho satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle. Psalm 103:6\tThe LORD executeth righteous acts, and judgments for all that are oppressed. Psalm 103:7\tHe made known his ways unto Moses, his doings unto the children of Israel. Psalm 103:8\tThe LORD is full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. Psalm 103:9\tHe will not always chide; neither will he keep his anger for ever. Psalm 103:10\tHe hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us after our iniquities. Psalm 103:11\tFor as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. Psalm 103:12\tAs far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. Psalm 103:13\tLike as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. Psalm 103:14\tFor he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. Psalm 103:15\tAs for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. Psalm 103:16\tFor the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. Psalm 103:17\tBut the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children; Psalm 103:18\tTo such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his precepts to do them. Psalm 103:19\tThe LORD hath established his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. Psalm 103:20\tBless the LORD, ye angels of his: ye mighty in strength, that fulfill his word, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Psalm 103:21\tBless the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. Psalm 103:22\tBless the LORD, all ye his works, in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul. Psalm 104:1\tBless the LORD O my soul, O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. Psalm 104:2\tWho coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: Psalm 104:3\tWho layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; who maketh the clouds his chariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind: Psalm 104:4\tWho maketh winds his messengers; his ministers a flaming fire: Psalm 104:5\tWho laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved for ever. Psalm 104:6\tThou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; the waters stood above the mountains. Psalm 104:7\tAt thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away; Psalm 104:8\tThey went up by the mountains, they went down by the valleys, unto the place which thou hadst founded for them. Psalm 104:9\tThou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. Psalm 104:10\tHe sendeth forth springs into the valleys; they run among the mountains: Psalm 104:11\tThey give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst. Psalm 104:12\tBy them the fowl of the heaven have their habitation, they sing among the branches. Psalm 104:13\tHe watereth the mountains from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. Psalm 104:14\tHe causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man; that he may bring forth food out of the earth: Psalm 104:15\tAnd wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengtheneth man’s heart. Psalm 104:16\tThe trees of the LORD are satisfied; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; Psalm 104:17\tWhere the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. Psalm 104:18\tThe high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the conies. Psalm 104:19\tHe appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. Psalm 104:20\tThou makest darkness, and it is night; Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. Psalm 104:21\tThe young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. Psalm 104:22\tThe sun ariseth, they get them away, and lay them down in their dens. Psalm 104:23\tMan goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. Psalm 104:24\tO LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. Psalm 104:25\tYonder is the sea, great and wide, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. Psalm 104:26\tThere go the ships; there is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to take his pastime therein. Psalm 104:27\tThese wait all upon thee, that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. Psalm 104:28\tThat thou givest unto them they gather; thou openest thine hand, they are satisfied with good. Psalm 104:29\tThou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their breath they die, and return to their dust. Psalm 104:30\tThou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the ground. Psalm 104:31\tLet the glory of the LORD endure for ever; let the LORD rejoice in his works: Psalm 104:32\tWho looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. Psalm 104:33\tI will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being. Psalm 104:34\tLet my meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in the LORD. Psalm 104:35\tLet sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD. Psalm 105:1\tGive thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name; make known his doings among the peoples. Psalm 105:2\tSing unto him, sing praises unto him; talk ye of all his marvelous works. Psalm 105:3\tGlory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. Psalm 105:4\tSeek ye the LORD and his strength; seek his face evermore. Psalm 105:5\tRemember his marvelous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; Psalm 105:6\tO ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. Psalm 105:7\tHe is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. Psalm 105:8\tHe hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; Psalm 105:9\tThe covenant which he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; Psalm 105:10\tAnd confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant: Psalm 105:11\tSaying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: Psalm 105:12\tWhen they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and sojourners in it; Psalm 105:13\tAnd they went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people. Psalm 105:14\tHe suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; Psalm 105:15\tSaying, Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm. Psalm 105:16\tAnd he called for a famine upon the land; he brake the whole staff of bread. Psalm 105:17\tHe sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant: Psalm 105:18\tHis feet they hurt with fetters; he was laid in chains of iron: Psalm 105:19\tUntil the time that his word came to pass; the word of the LORD tried him. Psalm 105:20\tThe king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free. Psalm 105:21\tHe made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: Psalm 105:22\tTo bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his senators wisdom. Psalm 105:23\tIsrael also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. Psalm 105:24\tAnd he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries. Psalm 105:25\tHe turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. Psalm 105:26\tHe sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen. Psalm 105:27\tThey set among them his signs, and wonders in the land of Ham. Psalm 105:28\tHe sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his words. Psalm 105:29\tHe turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. Psalm 105:30\tTheir land swarmed with frogs, in the chambers of their kings. Psalm 105:31\tHe spake, and there came swarms of flies, and lice in all their borders. Psalm 105:32\tHe gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. Psalm 105:33\tHe smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their borders. Psalm 105:34\tHe spake, and the locust came, and the cankerworm, and that without number, Psalm 105:35\tAnd did eat up every herb in their land, and did eat up the fruit of their ground. Psalm 105:36\tHe smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. Psalm 105:37\tAnd he brought them forth with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among his tribes. Psalm 105:38\tEgypt was glad when they departed; for the fear of them had fallen upon them. Psalm 105:39\tHe spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. Psalm 105:40\tThey asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. Psalm 105:41\tHe opened the rock, and waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. Psalm 105:42\tFor he remembered his holy word, and Abraham his servant. Psalm 105:43\tAnd he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with singing. Psalm 105:44\tAnd he gave them the lands of the nations; and they took the labour of the peoples in possession: Psalm 105:45\tThat they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws. Praise ye the LORD. Psalm 106:1\tPraise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. Psalm 106:2\tWho can utter the mighty acts of the LORD, or shew forth all his praise? Psalm 106:3\tBlessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times. Psalm 106:4\tRemember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people; O visit me with thy salvation: Psalm 106:5\tThat I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. Psalm 106:6\tWe have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. Psalm 106:7\tOur fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. Psalm 106:8\tNevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. Psalm 106:9\tHe rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness. Psalm 106:10\tAnd he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. Psalm 106:11\tAnd the waters covered their adversaries: there was not one of them left. Psalm 106:12\tThen believed they his words; they sang his praise. Psalm 106:13\tThey soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: Psalm 106:14\tBut lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. Psalm 106:15\tAnd he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. Psalm 106:16\tThey envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. Psalm 106:17\tThe earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. Psalm 106:18\tAnd a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. Psalm 106:19\tThey made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped a molten image. Psalm 106:20\tThus they changed their glory for the likeness of an ox that eateth grass. Psalm 106:21\tThey forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; Psalm 106:22\tWondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red Sea. Psalm 106:23\tTherefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. Psalm 106:24\tYea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word; Psalm 106:25\tBut murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. Psalm 106:26\tTherefore he lifted up his hand unto them, that he would overthrow them in the wilderness: Psalm 106:27\tAnd that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands. Psalm 106:28\tThey joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. Psalm 106:29\tThus they provoked him to anger with their doings; and the plague brake in upon them. Psalm 106:30\tThen stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. Psalm 106:31\tAnd that was counted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for evermore. Psalm 106:32\tThey angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: Psalm 106:33\tBecause they were rebellious against his spirit, and he spake unadvisedly with his lips. Psalm 106:34\tThey did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them; Psalm 106:35\tBut mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works: Psalm 106:36\tAnd they served their idols; which became a snare unto them: Psalm 106:37\tYea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons, Psalm 106:38\tAnd shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood. Psalm 106:39\tThus were they defiled with their works, and went a whoring in their doings. Psalm 106:40\tTherefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance. Psalm 106:41\tAnd he gave them into the hand of the nations; and they that hated them ruled over them. Psalm 106:42\tTheir enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. Psalm 106:43\tMany times did he deliver them; but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity. Psalm 106:44\tNevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry: Psalm 106:45\tAnd he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. Psalm 106:46\tHe made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. Psalm 106:47\tSave us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. Psalm 106:48\tBlessed be the LORD, the God or Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. Psalm 107:1\tBOOK V O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. Psalm 107:2\tLet the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary; Psalm 107:3\tAnd gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south. Psalm 107:4\tThey wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; they found no city of habitation. Psalm 107:5\tHungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. Psalm 107:6\tThen they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. Psalm 107:7\tHe led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city of habitation. Psalm 107:8\tOh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! Psalm 107:9\tFor he satisfieth the longing soul, and the hungry soul he filleth with good. Psalm 107:10\tSuch as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; Psalm 107:11\tBecause they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the Most High: Psalm 107:12\tTherefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help. Psalm 107:13\tThen they cried unto the LORD hi their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. Psalm 107:14\tHe brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. Psalm 107:15\tOh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! Psalm 107:16\tFor he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. Psalm 107:17\tFools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. Psalm 107:18\tTheir soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. Psalm 107:19\tThen they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. Psalm 107:20\tHe sendeth his word, and healeth them, and delivereth them from their destructions. Psalm 107:21\tOh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! Psalm 107:22\tAnd let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with singing. Psalm 107:23\tThey that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; Psalm 107:24\tThese see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. Psalm 107:25\tFor he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. Psalm 107:26\tThey mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul melteth away because of trouble. Psalm 107:27\tThey reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end. Psalm 107:28\tThen they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. Psalm 107:29\tHe maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Psalm 107:30\tThen are they glad because they be quiet: so he bringeth them unto the haven where they would be. Psalm 107:31\tOh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! Psalm 107:32\tLet them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders. Psalm 107:33\tHe turneth rivers into a wilderness, and watersprings into a thirsty ground; Psalm 107:34\tA fruitful land into a salt desert, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. Psalm 107:35\tHe turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, and a dry land into watersprings. Psalm 107:36\tAnd there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city of habitation; Psalm 107:37\tAnd sow fields, and plant vineyards, and get them fruits of increase. Psalm 107:38\tHe blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and he suffereth not their cattle to decrease. Psalm 107:39\tAgain, they are minished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow. Psalm 107:40\tHe poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way. Psalm 107:41\tYet setteth he the needy on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. Psalm 107:42\tThe upright shall see it, and be glad; and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. Psalm 107:43\tWhoso is wise shall give heed to these things, and they shall consider the mercies of the LORD. Psalm 108:1\tA Song, a Psalm Of David. My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory. Psalm 108:2\tAwake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early. Psalm 108:3\tI will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the peoples: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. Psalm 108:4\tFor thy mercy is great above the heavens, and thy truth reacheth unto the skies. Psalm 108:5\tBe thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth. Psalm 108:6\tThat thy beloved may be delivered, save with thy right hand, and answer us. Psalm 108:7\tGod hath spoken in his holiness; I will exult: I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. Psalm 108:8\tGilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of mine head; Judah is my sceptre. Psalm 108:9\tMoab is my washpot; upon Edom will I cast my shoe: over Philistia will I shout. Psalm 108:10\tWho will bring me into the fenced city? who hath led me unto Edom? Psalm 108:11\tHast not thou cast us off, O God? and thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts. Psalm 108:12\tGive us help against the adversary: for vain is the help of man. Psalm 108:13\tThrough God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our adversaries. Psalm 109:1\tFor the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; Psalm 109:2\tFor the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me: they have spoken unto me with a lying tongue. Psalm 109:3\tThey compassed me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause. Psalm 109:4\tFor my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer. Psalm 109:5\tAnd they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. Psalm 109:6\tSet thou a wicked man over him: and let an adversary stand at his right hand. Psalm 109:7\tWhen he is judged, let him come forth guilty; and let his prayer be turned into sin. Psalm 109:8\tLet his days be few; and let another take his office. Psalm 109:9\tLet his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. Psalm 109:10\tLet his children be vagabonds, and beg; and let them seek their bread out of their desolate places. Psalm 109:11\tLet the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let strangers make spoil of his labour. Psalm 109:12\tLet there be none to extend mercy unto him; neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children. Psalm 109:13\tLet his posterity be cut off; in the generation following let their name be blotted out. Psalm 109:14\tLet the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. Psalm 109:15\tLet them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. Psalm 109:16\tBecause that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, and the broken in heart, to slay them. Psalm 109:17\tYea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; and he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him. Psalm 109:18\tHe clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, and it came into his inward parts like water, and like oil into his bones. Let it be unto him as the raiment Psalm 109:19\twherewith he covereth himself, and for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually. Psalm 109:20\tThis is the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul. Psalm 109:21\tBut deal thou with me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me, Psalm 109:22\tFor I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. Psalm 109:23\tI am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. Psalm 109:24\tMy knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. Psalm 109:25\tI am become also a reproach unto them: when they see me, they shake their head. Psalm 109:26\tHelp me, O LORD my God; O save me according to thy mercy: Psalm 109:27\tThat they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it. Psalm 109:28\tLet them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, they shall be ashamed, but thy servant shall rejoice. Psalm 109:29\tLet mine adversaries be clothed with dishonour, and let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a mantle. Psalm 109:30\tI will give great thanks unto the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude. Psalm 109:31\tFor he shall stand at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that judge his soul. Psalm 110:1\tA Psalm of David. The LORD saith unto my lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. Psalm 110:2\tThe LORD shall send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Psalm 110:3\tThy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy power: in the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning, thou hast the dew of thy youth. Psalm 110:4\tThe LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. Psalm 110:5\tThe Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. Psalm 110:6\tHe shall judge among the nations, he shall fill the places with dead bodies; he shall strike through the head in many countries. Psalm 110:7\tHe shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head. Psalm 111:1\tPraise ye the LORD. I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation. Psalm 111:2\tThe works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. Psalm 111:3\tHis work is honour and majesty: and his righteousness endureth for ever. Psalm 111:4\tHe hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion. Psalm 111:5\tHe hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. Psalm 111:6\tHe hath shewed his people the power of his works, in giving them the heritage of the nations. Psalm 111:7\tThe works of his hands are truth and judgment; all his precepts are sure. Psalm 111:8\tThey are established for ever and ever, they are done in truth and uprightness. Psalm 111:9\tHe hath sent redemption unto his people; he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name. Psalm 111:10\tThe fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do thereafter: his praise endureth for ever. Psalm 112:1\tPraise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments. Psalm 112:2\tHis seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. Psalm 112:3\tWealth and riches are in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever. Psalm 112:4\tUnto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. Psalm 112:5\tWell is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth; he shall maintain his cause in judgment. Psalm 112:6\tFor he shall never be moved; the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. Psalm 112:7\tHe shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. Psalm 112:8\tHis heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his adversaries. Psalm 112:9\tHe hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy; his righteousness endureth for ever: his horn shall be exalted with honour. Psalm 112:10\tThe wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish. Psalm 113:1\tPraise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. Psalm 113:2\tBlessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Psalm 113:3\tFrom the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD’S name is to be praised. Psalm 113:4\tThe LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. Psalm 113:5\tWho is like unto the LORD our God, that hath his seat on high, Psalm 113:6\tThat humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth? Psalm 113:7\tHe raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the needy from the dunghill; Psalm 113:8\tThat he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. Psalm 113:9\tHe maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD. Psalm 114:1\tWhen Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; Psalm 114:2\tJudah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. Psalm 114:3\tThe sea saw it, and fled; Jordan was driven back. Psalm 114:4\tThe mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like young sheep. Psalm 114:5\tWhat aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? thou Jordan, that thou turnest back? Psalm 114:6\tYe mountains, that ye skip like rams; ye little hills, like young sheep? Psalm 114:7\tTremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; Psalm 114:8\tWhich turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters. Psalm 115:1\tNot unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake. Psalm 115:2\tWherefore should the nations say, Where is now their God? Psalm 115:3\tBut our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he pleased. Psalm 115:4\tTheir idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. Psalm 115:5\tThey have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; Psalm 115:6\tThey have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but they smell not; Psalm 115:7\tThey have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither speak they through their throat. Psalm 115:8\tThey that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them. Psalm 115:9\tO Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. Psalm 115:10\tO house of Aaron, trust ye in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. Psalm 115:11\tYe that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. Psalm 115:12\tThe LORD hath been mindful of us; he will bless us: he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. Psalm 115:13\tHe will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great. Psalm 115:14\tThe LORD increase you more and more, you and your children. Psalm 115:15\tBlessed are ye of the LORD, which made heaven and earth. Psalm 115:16\tThe heavens are the heavens of the LORD; but the earth hath he given to the children of men. Psalm 115:17\tThe dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence; Psalm 115:18\tBut we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye the LORD. Psalm 116:1\tI LOVE the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. Psalm 116:2\tBecause he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. Psalm 116:3\tThe cords of death compassed me, and the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. Psalm 116:4\tThen called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. Psalm 116:5\tGracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. Psalm 116:6\tThe LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me. Psalm 116:7\tReturn unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. Psalm 116:8\tFor thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. Psalm 116:9\tI will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. Psalm 116:10\tI believe, for I will speak: I was greatly afflicted: Psalm 116:11\tI said in my haste, All men are a lie. Psalm 116:12\tWhat shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me? Psalm 116:13\tI will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. Psalm 116:14\tI will pay my vows unto the LORD, yea, in the presence of all his people. Psalm 116:15\tPrecious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. Psalm 116:16\tO LORD, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thine handmaid; thou hast loosed my bonds. Psalm 116:17\tI will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. Psalm 116:18\tI will pay my vows unto the LORD, yea, in the presence of all his people. Psalm 116:19\tIn the courts of the LORD’S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD. Psalm 117:1\tO PRAISE the LORD, all ye nations; laud him, all ye peoples. Psalm 117:2\tFor his mercy is great toward us; and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD. Psalm 118:1\tO GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. Psalm 118:2\tLet Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. Psalm 118:3\tLet the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. Psalm 118:4\tLet them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever. Psalm 118:5\tOut of my distress I called upon the LORD: the LORD answered me and set me in a large place. Psalm 118:6\tThe LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? Psalm 118:7\tThe LORD is on my side among them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me. Psalm 118:8\tIt is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. Psalm 118:9\tIt is better to trust in the LORD, than to put confidence in princes. Psalm 118:10\tAll nations compassed me about: in the name of the LORD I will cut them off. Psalm 118:11\tThey compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: in the name of the LORD I will cut them off. Psalm 118:12\tThey compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: in the name of the LORD I will cut them off. Psalm 118:13\tThou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me. Psalm 118:14\tThe LORD is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation. Psalm 118:15\tThe voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. Psalm 118:16\tThe right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. Psalm 118:17\tI shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. Psalm 118:18\tThe LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. Psalm 118:19\tOpen to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto the LORD. Psalm 118:20\tThis is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter into it. Psalm 118:21\tI will give thanks unto thee, for thou hast answered me, and art become my salvation. Psalm 118:22\tThe stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner. Psalm 118:23\tThis is the LORD’S doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. Psalm 118:24\tThis is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. Psalm 118:25\tSave now, we beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, we beseech thee, send now prosperity. Psalm 118:26\tBlessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD. Psalm 118:27\tThe LORD is God, and he hath given us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.
