Psalm 1:1\tHappy the man who went not in the counsel of the unjust, and he stood not in the way of the sinful, and sat not in the seat of those scoffing. Psalm 1:2\tBut his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he will meditate day and night. Psalm 1:3\tAnd he was as a tree planted by the streams of water which will give its fruit in its time; his leaf shall not fall away, and all which he shall do shall be prospered. Psalm 1:4\tNot so the unjust: but as the chaff which the wind shall drive away. Psalm 1:5\tFor this, the unjust shall not rise up in judgment, and the sinful in the assembly of the just. Psalm 1:6\tFor Jehovah shall know the way of the just: but the way of the unjust shall perish. Psalm 2:1\tWherefore did the nations rage, and the peoples will meditate emptiness? Psalm 2:2\tThe kings of the earth will place themselves, and the princes sat down together against Jehovah and against his Messiah. Psalm 2:3\tWe will tear away his bands, and we will cast away his cords from us. Psalm 2:4\tHe dwelling in the heavens shall laugh: Jehovah shall deride to them. Psalm 2:5\tThen shall he speak to them in his anger, and in his burning shall he terrify them. Psalm 2:6\tAnd I anointed my king over Zion my holy mountain. Psalm 2:7\tI will recount for a law of Jehovah: He said to me, Thou my son; this day I begat thee. Psalm 2:8\tAsk of me and I will give the nations thine inheritance, and thy possession the extremities of the earth. Psalm 2:9\tThou shalt rule them with a rod of iron; as a potter’s vessel shalt thou break them in pieces. Psalm 2:10\tAnd now be circumspect, ye and be silent Silence. Psalm 2:11\tServe Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Psalm 2:12\tKiss the chosen lest he shall be angry, and ye perish in the way when his anger shall kindle as a little. Happy all they putting their trust in him. Psalm 3:1\tChanting of David in his fleeing from the face of Absalom his son. Jehovah, how they pressing upon me were multiplied! many rising up against me. Psalm 3:2\tMany saying to my soul, No salvation to him in God. Silence. Psalm 3:3\tAnd thou, Jehovah, a shield about me: my glory, and lifting up my head. Psalm 3:4\tWith my voice will I call to Jehovah, and he will answer me from his holy mountain. Silence. Psalm 3:5\tI lay down and I, shall sleep; I awaked: for Jehovah will uphold me. Psalm 3:6\tI shall not be afraid of ten thousand of people who sit round about upon me. Psalm 3:7\tArise, O Jehovah; save me, my God, for thou didst strike all mine enemies upon the cheek; thou didst break the teeth of the unjust. Psalm 3:8\tTo Jehovah salvation: upon thy people thy blessing. Silence. Psalm 4:1\tTo the overseer upon the stringed instruments; chanting of David. In my calling, answer me, O God of my justice: in straits thou didst enlarge me; compassionate me and hear my prayer. Psalm 4:2\tSons of man, how long mine honor for shame? Ye will love emptiness, ye will seek falsehood. Silence. Psalm 4:3\tAnd know ye that Jehovah separated the kind one to himself: Jehovah will hear in my calling to him. Psalm 4:4\tBe ye disturbed, and ye shall not sin: say in your heart upon your bed, Psalm 4:5\tSacrifice ye the sacrifices of justice, and trust to Jehovah. Psalm 4:6\tMany saying, Who will cause us to see good? Lift up upon us the light of thy face, O Jehovah. Psalm 4:7\tThou gavest gladness in my heart, from the time their grain and their new wine increased. Psalm 4:8\tIn peace together shall I lie down, and I shall sleep: for thou Jehovah alone wilt cause me to dwell confidently. Psalm 5:1\tTo the overseer of the pipes; chanting of David. Give ear to my sayings, O Jehovah; attend to my cry. Psalm 5:2\tAttend to the voice of my supplication, my King and my God: for to thee will I pray. Psalm 5:3\tO Jehovah, the morning thou wilt hear my voice; the morning I will set in order to thee, and I will look about. Psalm 5:4\tFor thou not a God delighting in injustice: and evil shall not dwell with thee. Psalm 5:5\tThe foolish shall not stand before thine eyes: thou hatedst all working vanity. Psalm 5:6\tThou shalt destroy those speaking falsehood: a man of bloods and deceit Jehovah will abhor. Psalm 5:7\tAnd I in the multitude of thy mercy will come into thy house; I will worship to thy holy temple in thy fear. Psalm 5:8\tO Jehovah, guide me into thy justice, for sake of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. Psalm 5:9\tNot steadfast in his mouth; the midst of them mischiefs; their throat a grave opened; they will be smooth with their tongue, Psalm 5:10\tPunish them, O God: they shall fall by their counsels; in the multitude of their transgressions thrust them down, for they rebelled against thee. Psalm 5:11\tAnd all they putting trust in thee shall rejoice forever: they shall shout for joy, and thou wilt cover over them: and they loving thy name shall exult in thee. Psalm 5:12\tFor thou wilt bless the just, O Jehovah: thou wilt surround him with favor as a shield. Psalm 6:1\tTo the overseer upon the stringed instruments upon the octave, chanting of David. O Jehovah, not in thine anger wilt thou correct me, and not in thy wrath wilt thou chastise me. Psalm 6:2\tCompassionate me, O Jehovah, for I languish: heal me, O Jehovah, for my bones trembled. Psalm 6:3\tMy soul trembled exceedingly: and thou, O Jehovah, how long? Psalm 6:4\tTurn back, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: save me for sake of thy mercy. Psalm 6:5\tFor in death none remembering thee: in hades who shall give thanks to thee? Psalm 6:6\tI was wearied with my sighing all the night I shall make my bed to swim with my tears; I shall make my couch to flow. Psalm 6:7\tMine eye fell away from grief; it grew old among all mine enemies. Psalm 6:8\tDepart from me, all ye doing vanity, for Jehovah heard the voice of my weeping. Psalm 6:9\tJehovah heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer. Psalm 6:10\tAll mine enemies shall be ashamed, they shall tremble exceedingly they shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly. Psalm 7:1\tSong of David which he sang to Jehovah upon the words of Cush, son of the right hand. O Jehovah my God, in thee I put My trust: save me from all pursuing me, and deliver me: Psalm 7:2\tLest he shall rend my soul as the lion, breaking in pieces and none delivering. Psalm 7:3\tO Jehovah my God, if I did this, if there is iniquity in my hand; Psalm 7:4\tIf I rewarded evil him being at peace with me; (and I will deliver mine enemy undeservedly:) Psalm 7:5\tThe enemy will pursue my soul, and overtake; and he will tread down my life to the earth, and he will cause mine honor to dwell upon the dust Silence. Psalm 7:6\tArise, O Jehovah, in thine anger, lift up thyself for the wrath of mine enemies: and awake to me the judgment thou didst command. Psalm 7:7\tAnd the assembly of the people shall surround thee: and for it turn back on high. Psalm 7:8\tJehovah shall judge peoples: judge me, O Jehovah, according to my justice, and according to mine integrity upon me. Psalm 7:9\tNow shall the evil of the unjust come to an end; and thou wilt direct the just one: for the just God tried hearts and reins. Psalm 7:10\tMy shield upon God, saving the upright of heart. Psalm 7:11\tGod judging the just one, and being angry in all the days. Psalm 7:12\tIf he shall not turn back, he will sharpen his sword; he bent his bow and he will be prepared. Psalm 7:13\tAnd he prepared to himself the instruments of death; he will work his arrows for those inflaming. Psalm 7:14\tBehold, lie will bring forth vanity, and he conceived trouble, and he will bring forth falsehood. Psalm 7:15\tHe dug a pit, and he will dig it out, and he will fall into the pitfall he will make. Psalm 7:16\tHis trouble shall turn back upon his head, and his violence shall come down upon his crown. Psalm 7:17\tI will confess to Jehovah according to his justice: and I will play on the harp to the name of Jehovah most high. Psalm 8:1\tTo the overseer upon the stringed instrument, chanting of David. O Jehovah our Lord, how mighty thy name in all the earth! who will set thy majesty over the heavens. Psalm 8:2\tOut of the mouth of children and sucklings thou hast founded strength on account of thine enemies, to cause the enemy and the avenger to cease. Psalm 8:3\tFor I shall see thy heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the stars which thou didst prepare. Psalm 8:4\tWhat is man that thou wilt remember him? and the son of man that thou wilt review him? Psalm 8:5\tAnd thou wilt diminish him a little more than the messengers, and thou wilt surround him with glory and honor. Psalm 8:6\tAnd thou wilt give him dominion over the works of thy hands; thou didst put all under his feet: Psalm 8:7\tSheep and oxen, all of them, and also the cattle of the field; Psalm 8:8\tAnd the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, passing through the paths of the seas. Psalm 8:9\tO Jehovah our Lord, how mighty thy name in all the earth! Psalm 9:1\tTo the overseer upon the death of Laban, chanting of David. I will praise, O Jehovah, with all my heart; I will recount all thy wonderful works. Psalm 9:2\tI will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will play on the harp to thy name, O Most High. Psalm 9:3\tIn the turning away of mine enemies backward, they shall be weak and perish from thy face. Psalm 9:4\tFor thou didst my judgment and my cause; thou satest upon the throne judging justice. Psalm 9:5\tThou didst rebuke the nations, thou didst destroy the unjust one, wiping off their name forever and ever. Psalm 9:6\tO enemy! desolations were wholly finished, and thou didst tear down cities; their remembrance perished with them. Psalm 9:7\tAnd Jehovah shall dwell forever: he prepared his throne for judgment. Psalm 9:8\tAnd he will judge the habitable globe in justice, he will judge peoples in uprightness. Psalm 9:9\tAnd Jehovah will be a height for the oppressed one, a height for times in straits. Psalm 9:10\tAnd they knowing thy name will trust in thee, for thou didst not forsake those seeking thee, O Jehovah. Psalm 9:11\tPlay on the harp to Jehovah dwelling in Zion: announce among the peoples his doings. Psalm 9:12\tFor he sought out bloods, be remembered them: he forget not the cry of the humble. Psalm 9:13\tCompassionate me, O Jehovah: see my affliction from those hating me, thou lifting me up from the gates of death: Psalm 9:14\tSo that I shall recount all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation. Psalm 9:15\tThe nations sank into the pit they made: in the net they hid, their foot was taken by it. Psalm 9:16\tAnd Jehovah was known by the judgment he did: by the work of his hands the unjust was snared. Meditation. Silence. Psalm 9:17\tThe unjust shall be turned away into hades, all the nations forgetting God. Psalm 9:18\tFor the needy shall not be forgotten forever: the hope of the poor shall not perish forever. Psalm 9:19\tArise, O Jehovah; man shall not be strengthened: the nations shall be judged before thee. Psalm 9:20\tPut fear to them, O Jehovah: the nations shall know they are man. Silence. Psalm 10:1\tWherefore, O Jehovah, wilt thou stand afar off? wilt thou hide for times in straits? Psalm 10:2\tIn the pride of the unjust he will burn the poor: they shall be taken in the devices that they purposed. Psalm 10:3\tFor the unjust boasted upon the desire of his soul, and he blessed him plundering, despising Jehovah. Psalm 10:4\tThe unjust according to the height of his anger, will not seek: God is not in all his thoughts. Psalm 10:5\tHis ways will be in pain in all time; thy judgments high from before him: all his enemies he will puff at them. Psalm 10:6\tSaying in his heart, I shall not be moved: to generation and generation for not in evil. Psalm 10:7\tHis mouth was filled with cursing and deceit and violence: under his tongue, trouble and vanity. Psalm 10:8\tSitting in ambush of the enclosures: in hiding-places he will slay the innocent: his eyes will be hid to the afflicted. Psalm 10:9\tHe will lie in wait in secret as the lion in her den: he will lie in wait to catch the poor one: he will catch the poor one in drawing him into his net. Psalm 10:10\tAnd crushing, he will bow down, and cast down the afflicted by his strong ones. Psalm 10:11\tSaying in his heart, God forgat: he hid his face; not seeing forever. Psalm 10:12\tArise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up thine hand: thou wilt not forget the poor. Psalm 10:13\tFor what did the unjust one despise God, saying in his heart, Thou wilt not search? Psalm 10:14\tThou sawest; for thou wilt look upon trouble and anger, to give with thine hand: the poor will be left to thee; thou wert the helper of the orphan. Psalm 10:15\tBreak the arm of the unjust and the evil one: thou wilt seek out his injustice; thou wilt not find. Psalm 10:16\tJehovah is King forever and ever: the nations perished from his land. Psalm 10:17\tThou heardest the desire of the poor, O Jehovah: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to attend. Psalm 10:18\tTo judge the orphan and the dejected, that the man of the earth shall no more add to make afraid. Psalm 11:1\tTo the overseer; of David. In Jehovah I put my trust: how will ye say to my soul, Wander ye to your mountain, little bird? Psalm 11:2\tFor behold, the unjust will bend the bow, they prepared their arrow upon the cord, they will shoot in darkness the upright of heart. Psalm 11:3\tIf the pillars shall be pulled down, what did the just one? Psalm 11:4\tJehovah is in his holy temple; Jehovah, in the heavens his throne: his eyes will behold, his eyelashes will try the sons of man. Psalm 11:5\tJehovah will try the just one: and the unjust and him loving violence, his soul hated. Psalm 11:6\tHe will rain upon the, unjust, snares, fire and brimstone, and a wind of violent heat: the portion of their cup. Psalm 11:7\tFor Jehovah the just loved justice; his face will behold the upright. Psalm 12:1\tTo the overseer upon the octave, chanting of David. Save, O Jehovah, for the merciful one ceased; for faithfulnesses failed from the sons of men. Psalm 12:2\tThey will speak vanity each with his neighbor: smooth lips, with a heart and a heart will they speak. Psalm 12:3\tJehovah will cut off all smooth lips, and the tongue speaking great things: Psalm 12:4\tWho said, By our tongues we shall prevail; our lips are with us: who is Lord over us? Psalm 12:5\tFrom the oppression of the poor, from the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, Jehovah will say; I will set with salvation, he will puff at him. Psalm 12:6\tThe sayings of Jehovah are pure sayings: silver tried in the crucible of the earth, purified seven times. Psalm 12:7\tThou, O Jehovah, shalt watch them, keep from this generation forever. Psalm 12:8\tThe unjust shall walk round about as the rising of a tempest to the sons of man. Psalm 13:1\tTo the overseer; chanting of David. Psalm 13:2\tHow long, O Jehovah, wilt thou wholly forget me? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? Psalm 13:3\tHow long shall I put counsels in my soul, grief in my heart the day? how long shall mine enemy rise up against me? Psalm 13:4\tLook upon, answer me, O Jehovah my God: enlighten mine eyes, lest I shall sleep the death; Psalm 13:5\tLest mine enemy shall say, I prevailed against him; mine adversaries shall exult when I shall be moved. Psalm 13:6\tAnd I trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall exult in thy salvation. I will sing to Jehovah for he benefited me. Psalm 14:1\tTo the overseer; of David. The fool said in his heart, No God. They were corrupted, they made their; works abominable, none doing good. Psalm 14:2\tJehovah looked down from the heavens upon the sons of men, to see is there he understanding, seeking God. Psalm 14:3\tAll turned away together, they were corrupted: none doing good, not even one. Psalm 14:4\tDid not the workers of vanity know? eating my people they ate bread; they called not Jehovah. Psalm 14:5\tThere they feared a fear: for God is in the generation of the just one. Psalm 14:6\tYe will shame the counsel of the poor, for Jehovah is his refuge. Psalm 14:7\tWho will give out of Zion the salvation of Israel? in Jehovah bringing back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall exult, Israel shall rejoice. Psalm 15:1\tChanting of David. O Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tent? who shall dwell in thy holy mountain? Psalm 15:2\tHe going blameless, and working justice, and speaking truth in his heart. Psalm 15:3\tSlandering not with his tongue, not doing evil to his neighbor, lifting up no reproach against his neighbor. Psalm 15:4\tIn his eyes a reprobate being despised; and those fearing Jehovah, he will honor. Swearing to the friend, and he will not change. Psalm 15:5\tNot giving his silver for interest, and gave not presents against the innocent. He doing these things shall not be moved forever. Psalm 16:1\tWriting of David Watch me, O God: in thee I put my trust. Psalm 16:2\tThou saidst to Jehovah, Thou my Lord: my good not upon thee. Psalm 16:3\tTo the holy ones that are upon the earth, they and the mighty ones, all my delight is in them. Psalm 16:4\tTheir labors shall be multiplied after they hastened: I will not gather their libations of blood, and I will not lift up their names upon my lips. Psalm 16:5\tJehovah the portion of my part and of my cup: thou didst hold up my lot. Psalm 16:6\tThe cords fell to me in sweetnesses; also the inheritance was bountiful upon me. Psalm 16:7\tI will praise Jehovah who counseled me: also the night my reins instructed me. Psalm 16:8\tI set Jehovah before me always: for from my right hand I shall not be moved. Psalm 16:9\tFor this my heart rejoiced, and my glory shall exult: also my flesh shall dwell with confidence. Psalm 16:10\tFor thou wilt not leave my soul to hades; thou wilt not give thy merciful ones to see corruption. Psalm 16:11\tThou wilt cause me to know the way of life: abundance of joys with thy face; favors in thy right hand forever. Psalm 17:1\tPrayer of David. Hear justice, O Jehovah, attend to my outcry, give ear to my prayer, not in lips of deceit. Psalm 17:2\tFrom thy face shall my judgment go forth; thine eyes will see uprightnesses. Psalm 17:3\tThou didst try my heart; thou didst review the night; thou didst refine me, thou wilt find nothing: I purposed, my mouth shall not pass by. Psalm 17:4\tFor the works of men, by the word of thy lips I watched the ways of the violent one. Psalm 17:5\tHold up my being straight in thy ways, my steps be not moved. Psalm 17:6\tI called thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: incline thine ear to me, hear my sayings. Psalm 17:7\tMake thy kindnesses distinguished, thou saving those putting their trust, from those rising up against thy right hand. Psalm 17:8\tWatch me as the pupil of the daughter of the eye: thou wilt hide me in the shadow of thy wings. Psalm 17:9\tFrom the face of the unjust that laid me waste, enemies against the soul will go round about against me. Psalm 17:10\tThey shut up their fat: their mouth spake in pride. Psalm 17:11\tWe went straight, now they surrounded us: their eyes they will set to incline to the earth; Psalm 17:12\tHis likeness as a lion will long for the prey, and as a young lion dwelling in secret places. Psalm 17:13\tArise, O Jehovah, anticipate his face, cast him down: deliver my soul from the unjust, thy sword. Psalm 17:14\tFrom men of thy hand, O Jehovah, from men of this world their portion in life, and thou wilt fill their belly with thy hidden things: they will be filled with sons, they left the remaining things to their children. Psalm 17:15\tI in justice shall see thy face: I shall be satisfied in awaking with thine appearance. Psalm 18:1\tTo the overseer; to the servant of Jehovah, of David who spake to Jehovah the words of this song in the day Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he will say, I will love thee, O Jehovah, my strength. Psalm 18:2\tJehovah is my rock and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock, I will put my trust in him; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my height. Psalm 18:3\tPraising, I will call upon Jehovah, and I shall be saved from mine enemies. Psalm 18:4\tThe pains of death surrounded me, and the torrents of Belial made me afraid. Psalm 18:5\tThe pains of hades surrounded me: the snares of death anticipated me. Psalm 18:6\tIn my straits I will call upon Jehovah, and to my God will I cry: he will hear my voice from his temple, and my cry will come before him into his ears. Psalm 18:7\tAnd it will be moved and the earth will tremble, and the foundations of the mountains will be moved and they will shake, for it was kindled to him. Psalm 18:8\tA smoke went up in his anger, and fire from his mouth will consume, and coals were kindled from it. Psalm 18:9\tAnd he will incline the heavens and come down: and gloom under his feet. Psalm 18:10\tAnd he will ride upon a cherub, and will fly: and he will fly upon the wings of the wind. Psalm 18:11\tHe will set darkness his covering; his tent round about him darknesses of waters, thick clouds. Psalm 18:12\tFrom the brightness before him the clouds passed over, hail and coals of fire. Psalm 18:13\tAnd Jehovah will thunder in the heavens, and the Most High will give his voice; hail and coals of fire. Psalm 18:14\tAnd he will send his arrows and scatter them; and he increased lightnings, and he will discomfit them. Psalm 18:15\tAnd the channels of waters will be seen, and the foundations of the habitable globe will be uncovered from thy rebuke, O Jehovah, from the breathing of the spirit of thine anger. Psalm 18:16\tHe will send forth from on high, he will take me, he will draw me out of many waters. Psalm 18:17\tHe will deliver me from my strong enemy, and from them hating me: for they were strong above me. Psalm 18:18\tThey will anticipate me in the day of my calamity, and Jehovah will be a support to me. Psalm 18:19\tAnd he will bring me forth to a wide place: he will deliver me, for he delighted in me. Psalm 18:20\tJehovah will recompense me according to my justice, according to the cleanness of my hands he will turn back to me. Psalm 18:21\tFor I watched the ways of Jehovah, and I acted not wickedly from my God. Psalm 18:22\tFor all his judgments are before me, and his laws I shall not put away from me. Psalm 18:23\tAnd I blameless with him, and I will watch myself from mine iniquity. Psalm 18:24\tAnd Jehovah will turn back to me according to my justice, and according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes. Psalm 18:25\tWith the kind thou wilt show thyself kind; and with the blameless man thou wilt be perfect. Psalm 18:26\tWith the purified thou wilt be purified, and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself perverse. Psalm 18:27\tThou wilt save the humble people, and thou wilt humble the eyes of the lifted up. Psalm 18:28\tFor thou wilt enlighten my lamp Jehovah my God will give light to my darkness. Psalm 18:29\tFor by thee I will break down a troop, and in my God I will leap upon the wall. Psalm 18:30\tGod, blameless his way: the saying of Jehovah being refined: a shield to all trusting in him. Psalm 18:31\tFor who is God besides Jehovah? or who a rock except our God? Psalm 18:32\tGod girding me with strength, and he will give my way blameless. Psalm 18:33\tSetting my feet as the hinds, and he will cause me to stand upon my heights. Psalm 18:34\tTeaching my hands to war, and a bow of brass was bent by mine arms. Psalm 18:35\tThou wilt give to me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand will uphold me, and thy clemency will enlarge me. Psalm 18:36\tThou wilt make broad my steps under me and my joints did not waver. Psalm 18:37\tI will pursue mine enemies, and I will overtake them: and I shall not turn back till consuming them.

Psalm 39:4\tO Jehovah, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; I shall know how I fail.

Psalm 40:6\tSacrifice and a gift thou didst not delight in; the ears thou didst pierce to me: burnt-offering and sin thou didst not ask. Psalm 40:7\tThen I said, Behold, I came: in the volume of the book it was written concerning me. Psalm 40:8\tTo do thine acceptance, O my God, I delighted; and thy law in the midst of my bowels. Psalm 40:9\tI announced good news, justice in the great convocation: behold, my lips I will not shut up, O Jehovah, thou knewest.

Psalm 42:3\tMy tears were to me bread day and night, in saying to me all the days, Where is thy God?

Psalm 44:18\tOur heart drew not back, and thou wilt not incline our going from thy path; Psalm 44:19\tFor thou didst crush us in the place of jackals, and thou wilt cover over us with the shadow of death. Psalm 44:20\tIf we forgat the name of our God, and stretched out our hands to a strange god: Psalm 44:21\tWill not God search this out? for he knew the secrets of the heart.

Psalm 49:20\tMan in honor shall not understand; being like as the beasts, they perished. Psalm 50:1\tChanting to Asaph.

Psalm 50:6\tAnd the heavens shall announce his justice: for God himself the judge. Silence. Psalm 50:7\tHear ye, my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God thy God. Psalm 50:8\tNot for thy sacrifices will I reprove thee and for thy burnt-offerings, being always before me. Psalm 50:9\tI will not take a bullock from thy house, from thy fold, he goats. Psalm 50:10\tFor to me all the beasts of the forest, the cattle upon a thousand mountains. Psalm 50:11\tI knew all the birds of the mountains and the moving things of the field with me. Psalm 50:12\tIf I shall hunger I shall not say to thee; for to me the habitable globe, and its fulness. Psalm 50:13\tShall I eat the flesh of the strong ones, and shall I drink the blood of goats? Psalm 50:14\tSacrifice to God thanksgiving, and repay thy vows to the Most High: Psalm 50:15\tAnd call upon me in the day of straits: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt honor me. Psalm 50:16\tAnd to the unjust one God said, What to thee to recount my law, and thou wilt lift up my covenant upon thy mouth? Psalm 50:17\tAnd thou hatedst instruction, and thou wilt cast my words behind thee. Psalm 50:18\tIf thou sawest a thief, and thou wilt run with him, and thy portion with those committing adultery. Psalm 50:19\tThou sentest thy month into evil, and thy tongue will contrive deceit. Psalm 50:20\tThou wilt sit, and thou wilt speak against thy brother; against the son of thy, mother thou wilt give a stumbling-block. Psalm 50:21\tThese things thou didst and I was silent; thou thoughtest, being, I shall be like to thee: I will reprove thee, and I will set it in order before thine eyes. Psalm 50:22\tUnderstand now this, ye forgetting God, lest I shall rend and none delivering. Psalm 50:23\tHe sacrificing praise shall honor me, and he setting the way I will cause him to look upon the salvation of God. Psalm 51:1\tTo the overseer: chanting to David; In the coming to him of Nathan the prophet, when he went in to Bathsheba. Compassionate me, O God, according to thy mercy: according to the Multitude of thy compassions wipe away my transgressions. Psalm 51:2\tMultiply to wash me from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. Psalm 51:3\tFor I shall know my transgression, and my sin is always before me. Psalm 51:4\tAgainst thee, thee alone, did I sin, and I did evil in thine eyes: so that thou wilt be justified in thy speaking, and thou wilt be pure in thy judging.

Psalm 51:16\tFor thou wilt not delight in sacrifice, and thou wilt not take pleasure in burnt-offering. Psalm 51:17\tThe sacrifices of God a spirit being broken: a heart being broken and crushed, O God, thou wilt not despise. Psalm 51:18\tDo Zion good in thy good will: thou wilt build the walls of Jerusalem. Psalm 51:19\tThen wilt thou delight in sacrifices of justice, in burnt-offering and whole burnt-offering: then they will bring up bullocks upon thine altar. Psalm 52:1\tTo the overseer instruction to David: In the coming of Doeg the Edomite to Saul, and he will say to him, David came to the house of Ahimelech. Why wilt thou boast in evil, thou strong one? the mercy of God is all the day. Psalm 52:2\tThy tongue will purpose mischief as a razor being sharpened, working deceit. Psalm 52:3\tThou lovedst evil above good; falsehood more than speaking justice. Silence. Psalm 52:4\tThou lovedst all words of destruction, a tongue of deceit. Psalm 52:5\tAlso God will break thee down forever; he will take thee and sweep thee away from the tent, and root thee up from the land of the living. Silence.

Psalm 53:1\tTo the overseer upon the stringed instrument: instruction to David. The fool said in his heart, No God. They were corrupted; they made iniquity abominable: none doing good. Psalm 53:2\tGod from the heavens looked forth upon the sons of man to see if there is he understanding, seeking God. Psalm 53:3\tThey all drew back: together they were corrupt; none doing good, not even one. Psalm 53:4\tDid not those transgressing know any thing? eating up my people, they ate bread: they called not upon God. Psalm 53:5\tThey feared a fear; there was no fear: for God scattered the bones of him making narrow: thou didst make ashamed, for God rejected them.

Psalm 54:3\tFor strangers rose up against me, and the powerful sought out my soul: they set not God before them. Silence. Psalm 54:4\tBehold, God a help to me: Jehovah with those upholding my soul. Psalm 54:5\tHe will turn back the evil to those oppressing me; in thy truth cut them off. Psalm 54:6\tIn willingness I will sacrifice to thee: I will praise thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good. Psalm 54:7\tFor from all straits he delivered me, and mine eyes looked upon my enemies. Psalm 55:1\tTo the overseer upon the stringed instrument, instruction to David. Give ear O God, to my prayer; thou wilt not hide thyself from my supplication. Psalm 55:2\tAttend to me and answer me; I shall flow down and make a noise in my complaint. Psalm 55:3\tFrom the voice of the enemy, from the face of the oppression of the unjust one: for they will bring down vanity upon me, for in anger they will lie in wait for me. Psalm 55:4\tMy heart will be pained within me, and the terrors of death fell upon me. Psalm 55:5\tFear and trembling will come upon me, and horror will cover me. Psalm 55:6\tAnd saying, Who will give me the wing-feather as a dove? I will fly away and settle down. Psalm 55:7\tBehold, I will move far off; fleeing away I will lodge in the desert. Silence. Psalm 55:8\tI will hasten escape to me from the rushing wind, from the storm. Psalm 55:9\tSwallow up, O Jehovah, divide their tongue: for I saw violence and strife in the city. Psalm 55:10\tDay and night they will surround it upon its walls: and vanity and trouble in her midst. Psalm 55:11\tMischief in her midst: oppression and deceit will not depart from her wide place. Psalm 55:12\tFor not the enemy will reproach me, and I will bear: not he hating me magnified against me; and I will hide from him. Psalm 55:13\tAnd thou a man according to my estimation, my friend and my acquaintance. Psalm 55:14\tWho together made sweet the intercourse, we will go into the house of God with the multitude. Psalm 55:15\tDeath shall lay waste upon them; they shall go down living to hades, for evils in their sojournings in the midst of them. Psalm 55:16\tI will call upon God, and Jehovah will save me: Psalm 55:17\tEvening and morning and noon I will meditate and make a noise, and he will hear my voice. Psalm 55:18\tHe redeemed my soul in peace from the encounter against me: for with many they were with me. Psalm 55:19\tGod will hear and he will humble them, and he dwelt of old. Silence. With whom no changes to them and they feared not God. Psalm 55:20\tHe stretched forth his hand in his recompenses: he profaned his covenant. Psalm 55:21\tThey were divided from the wrath of his mouth, and his heart drew near: his words were soft above oil, and they drawn swords. Psalm 55:22\tCast thy giving upon Jehovah and he will sustain thee: he will not give forever a wavering to the just one. Psalm 55:23\tAnd thou, O God, wilt bring them down to the well of destruction: men of bloods and deceit shall not halve their days; and I will trust in thee. Psalm 56:1\tTo the overseer for the silent dove of those far off: to David, a poem in the rovers taking him in Gath. Compassionate me, O God, for man panted after me; warring all the day, he will press me. Psalm 56:2\tMine enemies panted after me all the day: for many warring against me proudly. Psalm 56:3\tThe day I shall be afraid I will trust to thee. Psalm 56:4\tIn God I will praise his word, in God I trusted; I will not fear what flesh shall do to me. Psalm 56:5\tAll the day they will grieve my words: against me all their purposes for evil. Psalm 56:6\tThey will sojourn, they will hide, they will watch my heels as they waited for my soul. Psalm 56:7\tFor nothing is deliverance to them? In anger bring down the peoples, O God. Psalm 56:8\tThou didst recount my wanderings: set thou my tears in thy bottle: are they not in thy book? Psalm 56:9\tThen will mine enemies turn back in the day I shall call: this I knew, that God is for me. Psalm 56:10\tIn God I will praise the word: in Jehovah I will praise the word. Psalm 56:11\tIn God I trusted, I will not fear what man shall do to me. Psalm 56:12\tUpon me, O God, thy vows: I will repay praises to thee. Psalm 56:13\tFor thou deliveredst my soul from death: are not my feet from falling, to go about before God in the light of the living? Psalm 57:1\tTo the overseer, Thou wilt not destroy, to David a poem in his fleeing from the face of Saul in the cave. Compassionate me, O God, compassionate me: for in thee my soul put trust, and in the shadow of thy wings I will put my trust till calamity shall pass by. Psalm 57:2\tI will call to God the Most High; to God he completed for me. Psalm 57:3\tHe will send from the heavens and he will save me; he rebuked him panting after me. Silence. God will send forth his mercy and his truth.

Psalm 57:9\tI will praise thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples: I will play on the harp to thee among the nations. Psalm 57:10\tFor great even to the heavens thy mercy, and even to the clouds, thy truth. Psalm 57:11\tBe thou exalted over the heavens, O God: over all the earth, thy glory. Psalm 58:1\tTo the overseer, Thou wilt not destroy; to David a poem. Will ye indeed speak dumb justice? will ye judge justly, ye sons of man? Psalm 58:2\tAlso in heart ye will work evil; in the earth ye will roll the violence of your hands. Psalm 58:3\tThe unjust turned aside from the belly: they went astray from the womb, speaking falsehood. Psalm 58:4\tWrath to them according to the likeness of the wrath of a serpent: as the deaf adder will stop its ear; Psalm 58:5\tWhich will not hear to the voice of enchanters, charming with enchantments from wisdom. Psalm 58:6\tGod destroyed their teeth in their mouth: Jehovah broke down the young lions grinders. Psalm 58:7\tThey shall melt away as water shall go about to them: he will bend his arrow, they shall be as cut off.

Psalm 59:3\tFor behold, they lay in wait for my soul: the strong will gather against me; not my transgression and not my sin, O Jehovah. Psalm 59:4\tNot iniquity, they will run and they will prepare: be aroused to meet me, and see. Psalm 59:5\tAnd thou Jehovah God of armies, God of Israel, awake to review all the nations: thou wilt not compassionate all covering iniquity. Silence. Psalm 59:6\tThey will turn back at evening: they will make a noise as a dog, and they will surround the city. Psalm 59:7\tBehold, they will gush out with their mouth: swords in their lips: for who heard? Psalm 59:8\tAnd thou, O Jehovah, wilt laugh at them; thou wilt deride at all the nations. Psalm 59:9\tHis strength for thee will I watch: for God my height. Psalm 59:10\tMy God, his mercy shall anticipate me: God shall cause me to look upon mine enemies. Psalm 59:11\tThou wilt not kill them lest my people shall forget: cause them to wander to and fro by thy strength, and bring them down, O Jehovah, our shield. Psalm 59:12\tThe sin of their mouth the word of their lips, and they shall be taken in their pride: and from cursing and from falsehood they will recount.

Psalm 59:17\tMy help, to thee I will play on the harp, for God my height, the God of my mercy. Psalm 60:1\tTo the overseer upon the lily of song: poem to David to teach; In the setting on fire Aram of the two rivers, and Aram of the station; and Joab will turn back and strike Edom in the valley of salt, twelve thousand. O God, thou didst cast us off, thou didst break us down, thou wert angry; wilt thou turn back to us? Psalm 60:2\tThou didst shake the earth; thou didst rend it: heal its breakings, for it is depressed. Psalm 60:3\tThou didst cause thy people to see a hard thing: thou didst give us to drink the wine of reeling. Psalm 60:4\tThou gavest a signal to those fearing thee, to flee from the face of the bow. Silence. Psalm 60:5\tSo that thy beloved ones shall be delivered, save with thy right hand and answer us. Psalm 60:6\tGod spake in his holy place; I will rejoice, I will divide the shoulder, and I will measure the valley of booths.

Psalm 60:12\tIn God we will do strength and he will tread down our adversaries. Psalm 61:1\tTo the overseer upon the stringed instrument; to David. Hear, O God, my wailing; attend to my prayer. Psalm 61:2\tFrom the end of the earth I will call to thee, in the fainting of my heart: thou wilt lead me into the rock it will be lifted up above me. Psalm 61:3\tFor thou wert a refuge to me, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy. Psalm 61:4\tI will dwell in thy tent forever: I will put my trust in the covering of thy wings. Silence. Psalm 61:5\tFor thou, O God, heartiest to my vows: thou gavest the inheritance to those fearing thy name.

Surely my soul was silent to God: from him my salvation. Psalm 62:2\tSurely he my rock and my salvation, my height; I shall not be greatly moved. Psalm 62:3\tHow long will ye set upon a man? ye will kill all of you: as a wall inclining, a wall thrust down.

Psalm 62:10\tYe shall not trust in oppression, ye shall not become vain in plunder: if wealth shall increase ye shall not set the heart. Psalm 62:11\tOnce God spake; twice I heard this; that strength is to God. Psalm 62:12\tAnd to thee, O Jehovah, mercy: for thou wilt recompense to each according to his work. Psalm 63:1\tChanting to David in his being in the desert of Judah. O God thou art my God; I will seek thee: my soul thirsted for thee, my flesh longed for thee in a land of dryness, and thirsty without water. Psalm 63:2\tThus in the holy place I saw thee, to see thy strength and thy glory. Psalm 63:3\tFor thy mercy was good more than life; my lips shall praise thee.

Psalm 68:14\tIn the Almighty scattering kings in it, it shall be snow white in Salmon. Psalm 68:15\tThe mountain of God the mountain of Basilan; the mountain of height the mountain of Bashan. Psalm 68:16\tWherefore will ye lie in wait, ye mountains of heights? the mountain God desired to dwell in it: also Jehovah will dwell forever. Psalm 68:17\tThe chariot of God twice ten thousand thousands upon thousands: Jehovah among them, Sinai in the holy place. Psalm 68:18\tThou didst go up to height, thou didst take captive captivity: thou didst receive gifts in man, also those turning away, for Jehovah God to dwell. Psalm 68:19\tPraised be Jehovah; day by day the God of our salvation will lift up to us. Silence. Psalm 68:20\tThe God to us a God for salvations; and to Jehovah the Lord the goings forth to death. Psalm 68:21\tAlso God will crush the head of his enemies, the crown of him going about in his faults. Psalm 68:22\tJehovah said, I will turn back from Bashan; I will turn back from the depths of the sea: Psalm 68:23\tSo that thy foot shall shake in blood, the tongue of thy dogs from the enemies of him. Psalm 68:24\tThey saw thy goings, O God; the goings of my God, my King, in the holy place. Psalm 68:25\tThe chiefs went before, they playing on instruments, after; in the midst, girls beating the tabret. Psalm 68:26\tPraise ye God in the assemblies, Jehovah from the fountain of Israel. Psalm 68:27\tThen little Benjamin in a deep sleep, the chiefs of Judah their throng, the chiefs of Zebulon, the chiefs of Naphtali. Psalm 68:28\tThy God commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, this thou didst for us. Psalm 68:29\tFrom thy temple at Jerusalem kings shall bring a gift to thee. Psalm 68:30\tRebuke the beasts of the reed, the assembly of the strong ones, with the heifers of the peoples, prostrating themselves with pieces of silver: scatter the peoples, they will delight in wars. Psalm 68:31\tThe rich shall come out of Egypt; Cush shall cause its hand to run to God. Psalm 68:32\tYe kingdoms of the earth, sing to God; play on the harp to Jehovah. Silence. Psalm 68:33\tTo him riding upon the heavens of heavens of old, behold, he will give in his voice a voice of strength. Psalm 68:34\tYe shall give strength to God: upon Israel is his majesty, and his strength in the clouds. Psalm 68:35\tO God, being wonderful in thy holy things: the God of Israel, he gave strength and powers to the people. Praised be God. Psalm 69:1\tTo the overseer upon the lilies; to David. Save me, O God, for the waters came even to the soul. Psalm 69:2\tI sank in mire of depth, and no standing: I came into depths of waters and the floods overwhelmed me. Psalm 69:3\tI was wearied in my calling, my throat was dried up: mine eyes failed waiting for my God. Psalm 69:4\tThose hating me were many above the hairs of my head: mine enemies destroying me by falsehood were strong: then I will turn back what I plucked not away. Psalm 69:5\tO God, thou knewest for my folly, and my faults were not hid from thee. Psalm 69:6\tThey waiting for thee shall not be ashamed for me: O Lord Jehovah of armies, they shall not be disgraced for me, seeking thee, O God of Israel. Psalm 69:7\tBecause for thee I bare reproach: shame covered my face. Psalm 69:8\tI was polluted to my brethren, and a stranger to my mother’s sons. Psalm 69:9\tFor the zeal of thy house devoured me, and the reproaches of those reproaching thee fell upon me. Psalm 69:10\tAnd I will weep with fasting of my soul, and it will be for reproaches to me. Psalm 69:11\tAnd I will give my clothing sackcloth, and I for a parable to them. Psalm 69:12\tThey sitting in the gate will speak against me, and I was but the music of stringed instruments, of strong drink. Psalm 69:13\tAnd I, my prayer is to thee, O Jehovah, a time of acceptance: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy answer me, in the truth of thy salvation. Psalm 69:14\tDeliver me from the mire and I shall not sink: I shall be delivered from those hating me, and from the depths of waters. Psalm 69:15\tThe streams of water shall not overflow me, and the depth shall not swallow me down, and the well shall not close upon me her mouth. Psalm 69:16\tAnswer me, O Jehovah, for good is thy mercy: according to the multitude of thy compassions turn to me. Psalm 69:17\tAnd thou wilt not hide thy face from thy servant; for straits are to me: hasten to answer me. Psalm 69:18\tDraw near to my soul, redeem it: ransom me on account of mine enemies. Psalm 69:19\tThou knewest my reproach and my shame, and my disgrace: all mine adversaries are before thee. Psalm 69:20\tReproach broke my heart, and I shall be ill at ease: and I shall hope for comforting, and none; and for those consoling, and I found not. Psalm 69:21\tAnd they will give my food poison, and for my thirst they will give me vinegar to drink. Psalm 69:22\tTheir table shall be before them for a snare, for a retribution, for a cause of ruin. Psalm 69:23\tTheir eyes shall be darkened from seeing, and cause their loins to waver always. Psalm 69:24\tPour out upon them thy wrath, and the burning of thins anger shall overtake then). Psalm 69:25\tTheir fortress shall be desolated, and in their tents there shall none be dwelling. Psalm 69:26\tFor whom thou didst strike they pursued; and they will relate to the pain of thy wounded. Psalm 69:27\tThou wilt give iniquity to their iniquity, and they shall not come into thy justice. Psalm 69:28\tThey shall be wiped off from the book of the living, and with the just they shall not be written. Psalm 69:29\tAnd I am poor and dejected: and thy salvation, O God, shall set me up on high. Psalm 69:30\tI will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with praise. Psalm 69:31\tAnd it shall be good to Jehovah above an ox, a bullock shooting out horns and hoofs, Psalm 69:32\tThe poor saw, they shall be glad: and seeking Jehovah your heart shall live. Psalm 69:33\tFor Jehovah heard to the needy, and he despised not his hound. Psalm 69:34\tThe heavens shall praise him, and the earth, the sea, and every creeping thing in it. Psalm 69:35\tFor God will save Zion, and he will build the cities of Judah, and they shall dwell there and inherit it. Psalm 69:36\tAnd the seed of his servants shall inherit it, and they loving his name shall dwell in it. Psalm 70:1\tTo the overseer: to David, to bring to remembrance. O God, to deliver me; O Jehovah hasten to help me. Psalm 70:2\tThey seeking my soul shall be confused and ashamed: they shall be turned away behind; and they desiring my evils, shall be ashamed. Psalm 70:3\tThey shall be turned back for a reward of their shame, saying, Aha! Aha. Psalm 70:4\tAll seeking thee shall rejoice and be glad in thee, and they shall say always, God shall be magnified; they loving thy salvation. Psalm 70:5\tAnd I am poor and needy: O God, hasten to me, my help and my deliverer; thou, O Jehovah, wilt not delay. Psalm 71:1\tIn thee, O Jehovah, I put my trust; shall not be ashamed forever. Psalm 71:2\tIn thy justice thou wilt deliver me, and let me escape: incline to me thine ear and save me. Psalm 71:3\tBe thou to me for a rock of refuge to come always: thou didst command to save me, for thou my rock and my fortress. Psalm 71:4\tMy God, deliver me from the hand of the unjust one, from the hand of him transgressing, and the violent one. Psalm 71:5\tFor thou my hope, O Lord Jehovah: my trust from my youth. Psalm 71:6\tUpon thee was I supported from the womb: from the bowels of my mother thou didst separate me: in thee my praise always. Psalm 71:7\tI was as a wonder to many: and thou my refuge of strength. Psalm 71:8\tMy mouth shall be filled with thy praise, thy magnificence all the day. Psalm 71:9\tThou wilt not cast me off to the time of old age; as my strength fails thou wilt not forsake me. Psalm 71:10\tFor mine enemies said to me, and they watching my soul took counsel together, Psalm 71:11\tSaying, God forsook him: pursue him and take him, for none delivering. Psalm 71:12\tO God, thou wilt not be far off from me: my God, hasten for my help. Psalm 71:13\tThey lying in wait for my soul shall be ashamed; they shall be finished; they seeking my evil shall be covered with reproach and shame. Psalm 71:14\tAnd I will always hope, and I added upon all thy praise. Psalm 71:15\tMy mouth shall recount thy justice, all the day thy salvation, for I knew not numbers. Psalm 71:16\tI will go in the strength of the Lord Jehovah: I will keep in remembrance thy justice, thine alone. Psalm 71:17\tO God, thou didst teach me from my youth: and even to this will I announce thy wonders. Psalm 71:18\tAnd also even to old age and grayness, O God, thou wilt not forsake me; till I shall announce thine arm to the generation, thy strength to every one who shall come: Psalm 71:19\tAnd thy justice, O God, even to height, who didst great things: O God, who like thee? Psalm 71:20\tWho didst cause us to see great straits and evils; thou wilt turn back, thou wilt preserve us alive, and from the depths of the earth thou wilt turn back, thou wilt bring us up. Psalm 71:21\tThou wilt increase my greatness, thou wilt surround me, thou wilt comfort me. Psalm 71:22\tAlso I will praise thee with the instrument of the harp; thy truth, O God, I will play on the harp, to thee, O Thou, Holy One of Israel. Psalm 71:23\tMy lips shall rejoice when I shall play on the harp to thee, and my soul which thou redeemedst. Psalm 71:24\tAlso my tongue all the day shall celebrate thy justice; for they were confused, for they seeking my evil were ashamed. Psalm 72:1\tTo Solomon. O God, thou wilt give thy judgments to the king, and thy justice to the king’s son. Psalm 72:2\tHe shall judge thy people in justice, and thy poor in judgment. Psalm 72:3\tThe mountains shall lift up peace to the people, and the hills in justice. Psalm 72:4\tHe shall judge the poor of the people, and save to the sons of the needy, and he will break in pieces him oppressing. Psalm 72:5\tAnd they shall fear thee with the sun and before the moon, generation of generations. Psalm 72:6\tHe shall come down as rain upon a fleece, as showers of pouring rain upon the earth. Psalm 72:7\tThe just one shall break forth in his days, and a multitude of peace even till no moon. Psalm 72:8\tAnd he shall rule from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. Psalm 72:9\tInhabitants of the desert shall bow before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust. Psalm 72:10\tThe kings of Tarshish and the islands shall turn back a gift, the kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring a present. Psalm 72:11\tAnd all kings shall worship to him: all nations shall serve him. Psalm 72:12\tFor we will deliver the needy from the powerful one, and the poor and no helper to him. Psalm 72:13\tHe will spare for the poor and the needy, and he will save the souls of the needy. Psalm 72:14\tFrom oppression and from violence he will redeem their soul, and their blood shall be precious in his eyes. Psalm 72:15\tAnd he shall live, and there shall be given to him from the gold of Sheba: and there shall always be supplications for him; all the day shall they praise him. Psalm 72:16\tThere shall be diffusion of grain in the earth upon the head of the mountains; its fruit shall shake as Lebanon, and they shall blossom from the city as the grass of the earth. Psalm 72:17\tHis name shall be forever: his name shall flourish before the sun: and they shall be praised in him: all nations shall pronounce him happy. Psalm 72:18\tPraised be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, doing wonders himself alone. Psalm 72:19\tAnd praised be the name of his glory forever; and his glory shall fill all the earth. Amen and Amen. Psalm 72:20\tThe prayers of David son of Jesse were completed. Psalm 73:1\tChanting to Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, to the clean of heart. Psalm 73:2\tAnd I, my feet nearly turned aside; my going was almost poured out. Psalm 73:3\tFor I was envious at the foolish; I shall see the peace of the unjust. Psalm 73:4\tFor not the pains to their death, and their body fat. Psalm 73:5\tThey are not in the trouble of men, and with man they shall not be struck. Psalm 73:6\tFor this, pride surrounded them as a neck-chain; the dress of violence will cover to them. Psalm 73:7\tTheir eye will come forth from fat: they passed over the imaginations of the heart. Psalm 73:8\tThey will mock and speak in evil of oppression: they will speak from elevation. Psalm 73:9\tThey set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue will go in the earth. Psalm 73:10\tFor this, his people will turn back here: and full water shall be sucked out to them. Psalm 73:11\tAnd they said, How did God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High? Psalm 73:12\tBehold, these the unjust, and they being secure of the world increased riches. Psalm 73:13\tSurely in vain I cleansed my heart, and I will wash my hands in cleanness. Psalm 73:14\tAnd I am struck all the day, and my reproofs for the mornings. Psalm 73:15\tIf I said, I will recount thus; behold, I transgressed against the generation of thy sons. Psalm 73:16\tAnd I shall think to know this, it is labor in mine eyes. Psalm 73:17\tTill I shall come to the holy place of God I shall not understand for their latter state. Psalm 73:18\tSurely in slippery places thou wilt set them, to cast them down into ruins. Psalm 73:19\tHow they were for desolation as in a moment they perished; they were finished from sudden destruction. Psalm 73:20\tAs a dream of him awaking, O Jehovah, in awaking thou wilt despise their image. Psalm 73:21\tFor my heart will be embittered, and my loins were hard. Psalm 73:22\tAnd I stupid, and I shall not know, and I was a beast with thee. Psalm 73:23\tAnd I always with thee: thou didst hold by my right hand. Psalm 73:24\tIn thy counsel thou wilt guide me, and after, thou wilt receive me with glory. Psalm 73:25\tWho to me in the heavens? and from thee I desired nothing in the earth. Psalm 73:26\tMy flesh failed and my heart: the rock of my heart and my portion is God forever. Psalm 73:27\tFor behold, they being far off from thee shall perish: thou didst lay waste all committing fornication from thee. Psalm 73:28\tAnd I drawing near to God, it is good for me: I put in the Lord Jehovah my refuge, to recount all thy works. Psalm 74:1\tUnderstanding to Asaph. Wherefore, O God, didst thou reject forever? will thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy feeding? Psalm 74:2\tRemember thine assembly thou didst purchase of old; thou didst redeem the rod of thine inheritance; this mount Zion thou didst dwell in it. Psalm 74:3\tLift up thy steps to desolations forever; all the evil of the enemy in the holy place. Psalm 74:4\tThine enemies roared in the midst of thine appointment; they set their signs, signs. Psalm 74:5\tIt will be known according to bringing the axes upwards upon the thicket of wood. Psalm 74:6\tAnd now with axes and hammers they will beat her engravings. Psalm 74:7\tThey cast thy holy place into fire, to the earth they defiled the tent of thy name. Psalm 74:8\tThey said in their heart, We will rage against them together: they burnt up all the appointments of God in the earth. Psalm 74:9\tWe saw not our signs, no more a prophet: and not with us will it be known how long. Psalm 74:10\tHow long, O God, shall the enemy reproach? Shall the enemy despise thy name forever? Psalm 74:11\tWherefore wilt thou turn back thy hand, and thy right hand? from the midst of thy bosom completely. Psalm 74:12\tAnd God my king of old working salvations in the midst of the earth. Psalm 74:13\tThou didst cleave the sea in thy strength: thou didst break the heads of the dragons upon the waters. Psalm 74:14\tThou didst break the heads of the sea monster, thou wilt give him for food to the people, to the inhabitants of the desert. Psalm 74:15\tThou didst cleave asunder the fountain and the torrent: thou driedst up the rivers of strength. Psalm 74:16\tTo thee the day, also to thee the night: thou didst prepare the light and the sun. Psalm 74:17\tThou didst set all the bounds of the earth: summer and autumn thou didst form them. Psalm 74:18\tRemember this, the enemy reproached Jehovah, and the foolish people despised thy name. Psalm 74:19\tThou wilt not give the soul of thy turtle-dove to the beast: the life of thy poor thou wilt not forget forever. Psalm 74:20\tLook to thy covenant: for the dark places of the earth were filled with habitations of violence. Psalm 74:21\tThe poor one shall not turn back ashamed: the humble and the needy shall praise thy name. Psalm 74:22\tArise, O God, contend thy contention: remember thy reproach from the foolish all the day. Psalm 74:23\tThou wilt not forget the voice of thine adversaries: the pride of them rising up against thee going up always. Psalm 75:1\tTo the overseer, Thou wilt not destroy: chanting to Asaph a song. We confessed to thee, O God, we confessed: and thy name is near, thy wonders recounted. Psalm 75:2\tFor I will take the appointment, I will judge uprightnesses. Psalm 75:3\tThe earth and all dwelling in it being melted: I made even its pillars. Silence. Psalm 75:4\tI said to the foolish, Ye shall not be foolish; and to the unjust, Ye shall not lift up the horn: Psalm 75:5\tYe shall not lift up your horn to elevation: ye will speak with an impudent neck. Psalm 75:6\tFor not from the going forth and from the west, and not from the desert the lifting up. Psalm 75:7\tFor God is judge: he will humble this, and this he will lift up. Psalm 75:8\tFor a cup in the hand of Jehovah, and the wine red, being full of mixed wine; and he will pour out from this: but its lees all the unjust of the earth shall suck out, they shall drink. Psalm 75:9\tAnd I will announce forever; I will play on the harp to the God of Jacob. Psalm 75:10\tAnd all the horns of the unjust will I cut off; the horns of the just one shall be exalted. Psalm 76:1\tTo the overseer upon the stringed instrument: chanting to Asaph song. In Judah was God known: great his name in Israel. Psalm 76:2\tAnd his booth shall be in peace, and his dwelling in Zion. Psalm 76:3\tThere he broke the lightnings of the bow, the shield and the sword, and war. Silence. Psalm 76:4\tThou art light, being magnified from the mountains of fresh foliage. Psalm 76:5\tThe mighty of heart were spoiled, they slumbered their sleep: and all the men of strength found not their hands. Psalm 76:6\tFrom thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, the chariot and the horse lay in a deep sleep. Psalm 76:7\tThou art feared, thou: and who shall stand before thee from the time of thine anger? Psalm 76:8\tFrom the heavens thou didst cause judgment to be heard; the earth feared and rested. Psalm 76:9\tIn God’s rising up to judgment, to save all the poor of the earth. Silence. Psalm 76:10\tFor the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath thou wilt gird up. Psalm 76:11\tVow, ye, and repay to Jehovah your God: all being round about him shall bring a gift for fear. Psalm 76:12\tHe will cut off the spirit of leaders, being terrible to the kings of the earth. Psalm 77:1\tTo the overseer for Jeduthun: to Asaph a chanting. My voice to God, and I will cry with my voice to God, and he gave ear to me. Psalm 77:2\tIn the day of my straits I sought Jehovah: my hand was stretched out at night, and it will not be slack: my soul refused to be comforted. Psalm 77:3\tI will remember God and I shall be disquieted: I shall be depressed and my spirit will languish. Silence. Psalm 77:4\tThou didst hold mine eyes watching: I was moved, and I will not speak. Psalm 77:5\tI reckoned the days of old, the everlasting years. Psalm 77:6\tI will remember my stringed instruments in the night: I shall meditate with my heart, and my spirit will search out. Psalm 77:7\tWill Jehovah reject forever? and will he no more add to be satisfied? Psalm 77:8\tDid his mercy fail forever? his word come to an end to generation and generation? Psalm 77:9\tDid God forget to compassionate? or in anger did he gather his compassion? Silence. Psalm 77:10\tAnd saying, This has made me sick: the years of the right hand of the Most High. Psalm 77:11\tI will remember the works of Jah: for I will remember the ancient time of thy wonder. Psalm 77:12\tAnd I meditated in all thy work, and I will think upon all thy doings. Psalm 77:13\tO God, thy way is in the holy place: what God great as God? Psalm 77:14\tThou the God doing wonder: thou didst make known thy strength among the peoples. Psalm 77:15\tThou didst redeem with the arm thy people the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Silence. Psalm 77:16\tThe waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they will tremble, also the depths will be moved. Psalm 77:17\tThe clouds poured out waters: the clouds gave a voice: also thine arrows will go about. Psalm 77:18\tThe voice of thy thunder in the wheel: the lightnings lightened the habitable globe: the earth moved and it will shake. Psalm 77:19\tIn the sea thy way, and thy paths in many waters, and thy heels were not known. Psalm 77:20\tThou didst guide thy people as sheep by the hand of Moses and Aaron. Psalm 78:1\tInstruction to Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the sayings of my mouth. Psalm 78:2\tI will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter enigmas from ancient time: Psalm 78:3\tWhich we heard and we shall know them, and our fathers recounted to us. Psalm 78:4\tIt was not hid from their sons, to a later generation recounting the praises of Jehovah and his strength, and his wonders which he did. Psalm 78:5\tFor he raised up a testimony in Jacob and set a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to make them known to their sons: Psalm 78:6\tSo that a later generation shall know; sons shall be born, they shall rise up and recount to their sons. Psalm 78:7\tAnd they shall set their hope in God, and they shall not forget the works of God, and they shall watch his commands. Psalm 78:8\tAnd they shall not be as their fathers, a generation turning away and bitter, a generation it prepared not its heart, and its spirit was not firm with God. Psalm 78:9\tThe sons of Ephraim bending, lifting up the bow, turned in the day of the encounter. Psalm 78:10\tThey watched not the covenant of God, and in his law they refused to go; Psalm 78:11\tAnd they will forget his works and his wonders which he caused them to see. Psalm 78:12\tBefore their fathers he did a wonder in the land of Egypt, the field of loading. Psalm 78:13\tHe rent the sea and he will cause them to pass through; and he will cause the waters to stand as a heap. Psalm 78:14\tAnd he will guide them in a cloud the day, and all the night in a light of fire. Psalm 78:15\tHe will rend the rocks in the desert, and give drink as the great abyss. Psalm 78:16\tAnd he will bring forth flowings from the rock, and bring down waters as rivers. Psalm 78:17\tAnd they will yet add to sin against him to embitter the Most High in a dry land. Psalm 78:18\tAnd they will tempt God in their heart to ask food for their soul. Psalm 78:19\tAnd they will speak against God; they said, Will God be able to arrange a table in the desert? Psalm 78:20\tBehold, he struck the rock and waters will flow, and torrents will pour out; will he be able also to give bread? or will he prepare flesh for his people? Psalm 78:21\tFor this Jehovah heard and he will overflow, and a fire was kindled in Jacob, and also anger came up upon Israel. Psalm 78:22\tFor they believed not in God, and they trusted not in his salvation. Psalm 78:23\tAnd he commanded the clouds from above, and he opened the doors of the heavens. Psalm 78:24\tAnd he will rain upon them manna to eat, and he gave the grain of the heavens to them. Psalm 78:25\tMan ate the bread of the strong: he sent to them provision to fulness. Psalm 78:26\tHe will cause the east wind to go forth in the heavens, and by his strength he will lead the south wind. Psalm 78:27\tAnd he will rain flesh upon them as the dust, birds of feather as the sand of the seas. Psalm 78:28\tAnd it shall fall in the midst of his camp, round about to his habitations. Psalm 78:29\tAnd they shall eat and be well filled: and he will bring to them their desire. Psalm 78:30\tThey turned not away from their desire, yet their food in their mouth. Psalm 78:31\tAnd the anger of God came up upon them, and he will slay among their fat ones and he bowed down the chosen of Israel. Psalm 78:32\tIn all this they yet sinned, and they believed not in his wonders. Psalm 78:33\tAnd he will finish their days in vanity, and their years in terror. Psalm 78:34\tWhen he slew them and they sought him, and they turned back and sought for God. Psalm 78:35\tAnd they will remember that God is their Rock, and God the Most High redeemed them. Psalm 78:36\tAnd they will deceive with their mouth, and with their tongue they will lie to him. Psalm 78:37\tAnd their heart was not right with him, and they were not firm in his covenant. Psalm 78:38\tAnd he being compassionate will cover iniquity, and he will not destroy: and he multiplied to turn back his anger, and he will not rouse up all his wrath. Psalm 78:39\tAnd he will remember that they are flesh; a spirit going and not turning back. Psalm 78:40\tHow often they will embitter him in the desert! they will grieve him in the waste. Psalm 78:41\tAnd they will turn back and tempt God, and they broke in upon the Holy One of Israel. Psalm 78:42\tThey remembered not his hand the day which he redeemed them from the enemy; Psalm 78:43\tHow he set in Egypt his signs, and his wonders in the field of loading. Psalm 78:44\tAnd he turned to blood their rivers, and their flowings they shall not drink. Psalm 78:45\tHe will send forth among them the gad-fly, and they shall devour them; and frogs, and they shall destroy them. Psalm 78:46\tAnd he will give their produce to the devourer, and their labor to the locust. Psalm 78:47\tHe will kill their vine with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost. Psalm 78:48\tHe will deliver their cattle to the hail, and their possessions to the flames. Psalm 78:49\tHe will send upon them the burning of his anger, outpouring and wrath, and straits, sending evil messengers. Psalm 78:50\tHe will prepare a beaten path for his anger; he spared not their soul from death, and their life he delivered to the word; Psalm 78:51\tAnd he will strike all the firstborn in Egypt; the first-fruits of their toils in the tents of Ham: Psalm 78:52\tHe will remove his people as sheep, and he will lead them as a flock in the desert. Psalm 78:53\tAnd he will guide them securely and they feared not: and the sea covered their enemies. Psalm 78:54\tAnd he will bring them to the bound of his holy place, this mountain his right hand purchased. Psalm 78:55\tAnd he will cast out the nations from their face, and he will divide them by lot in the measure of inheritance, and he will cause the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. Psalm 78:56\tAnd they will tempt and embitter God the Most High, and they watched not his testimonies. Psalm 78:57\tAnd they will draw back, and they will transgress as their fathers: they were turned as a bow of deceit. Psalm 78:58\tAnd they will make him angry with their heights, and they will provoke him to jealousy with their carved images. Psalm 78:59\tGod heard and he will overflow, and he will greatly contemn in Israel. Psalm 78:60\tAnd he cast off the tent of Shiloh, the tent he pitched among man. Psalm 78:61\tAnd he will give his strength to captivity, and his beauty into the hand of the enemy. Psalm 78:62\tAnd he will deliver his people to the sword, and he overflowed upon his inheritance. Psalm 78:63\tThe fire devoured his young men, and his virgins wailed not. Psalm 78:64\tHis priests fell by the sword, and his widows wept not. Psalm 78:65\tAnd Jehovah will awake as he sleeping, as the strong one shouting from wine. Psalm 78:66\tAnd he will strike his enemies behind: he gave to them reproach forever.

O God, the nations came into thine inheritance; they defiled thy holy temple; they set Jerusalem for ruins. Psalm 79:2\tThey gave the corpses of thy servants food to the birds of the heavens, the flesh of thy godly ones to the beasts of the earth. Psalm 79:3\tThey poured out their blood as water round about Jerusalem; and none burying. Psalm 79:4\tWe were a reproach to our neighbors, a derision and scorn to those being round about us. Psalm 79:5\tHow long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry forever? shall thy jealousy burn as fire? Psalm 79:6\tPour out thy wrath upon the nations which knew thee not, and upon the kingdoms which called not upon thy name. Psalm 79:7\tFor devouring Jacob and they laid Waste his dwelling.

Psalm 80:6\tThou wilt set us a strife to our neighbors, and our enemies will deride to themselves. Psalm 80:7\tO God of armies, turn us back and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.

Psalm 80:10\tIts Shadow covered the mountains, and its branches the cedars of God. Psalm 80:11\tThou Wilt send forth her boughs even to the sea, and her suckers to the river. Psalm 80:12\tWherefore didst thou break down her walls, and all passing by the way plucked her? Psalm 80:13\tThe swine from the forest will lay it waste, and the Moving thing of the field will feed upon it. Psalm 80:14\tO God of armies, turn back now: look from the heavens and see, and review this vine; Psalm 80:15\tAnd the plant which thy right hand planted, and upon the son thou madest strong for thee, Psalm 80:16\tBurning it in fire, cutting it down; from the rebuke of thy face they shall perish. Psalm 80:17\tThy hand shall be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man thou madest Strong for thee.

Psalm 81:3\tStrike ye the trumpet in the new in the full moon, for the day of our festival. Psalm 81:4\tFor it is a law to Israel, a judgment to the God of Jacob. Psalm 81:5\tHe set him a testimony in Joseph in his going forth upon the land of Egypt: I shall hear a lip I knew not. Psalm 81:6\tI removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands shall past by from the basket.

Psalm 82:8\tArise, O God, judge the earth: for then shalt inherit in all nations. Psalm 83:1\tA song of chanting to Asaph. O God, not stillness to thee: thou wilt not be silent, and thou wilt not rest, O God. Psalm 83:2\tFor behold, thine enemies will be clamorous; and they hating thee lifted up the head.

Psalm 83:4\tThey said, Come, and we will cut them off from a nation; and the name of Israel shall no more be remembered. Psalm 83:5\tFor they counseled together with the heart: they will cut out a covenant against thee: Psalm 83:6\tThe tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagarites. Psalm 83:7\tGebal and Ammon and Amalek; the rovers with the inhabitants of Tyre; Psalm 83:8\tAlso Assur was joined with them: they were an arm to the sons of Lot Silence. Psalm 83:9\tDo to them as Midian, as Sisera, as Jabin, at the torrent Bison: Psalm 83:10\tThey were destroyed at the fountain of the dwelling: they were dung to the earth. Psalm 83:11\tSet them their nobles as Oreb, and as Zeeb: and as Zebah and as Zalmunna, all their princes: Psalm 83:12\tWho said, We will inherit for us the dwellings of God. Psalm 83:13\tO my God, set them as a wheel; as straw before the wind. Psalm 83:14\tAs fire will burn the forest, and as the flame will cause the mountains to burn.

Psalm 89:40\tThou didst break down all his walls; thou didst set his fortifications a ruin. Psalm 89:41\tAll those passing over the way plundered him: he was a reproach to his neighbors: Psalm 89:42\tThou didst raise up the right hand of his adversaries; thou didst cause all his enemies to rejoice. Psalm 89:43\tAlso thou wilt turn hack the edge of his sword, and thou caused him not to rise up in war. Psalm 89:44\tThou didst cause to cease from his cleansing, and his throne thou didst cast it down to the earth.

Psalm 90:5\tThou didst overwhelm them; in sleep shall they be; in the morning as the grass will pass away. Psalm 90:6\tIn the morning it will flourish, and it will pass away at evening; it will be cut off and will dry up. Psalm 90:7\tFor we were finished in thine Anger, and in thy wrath we were terrified. Psalm 90:8\tThou didst set our iniquities before thee, our hidden things before the light of thy face. Psalm 90:9\tFor all our days turned away in thy wrath: we finished our years as a meditation. Psalm 90:10\tThe days of our years, in them seventy years; and if in strengths, eighty years, and their pride labor and vanity; for being soon cut off and we shall fly away.

Psalm 104:24\tHow thy works were multiplied. O Jehovah! in wisdom thou madest them all: the earth was filled with thy possessions. Psalm 104:25\tThis great and broad sea, hands there of the creeping thing, and no number of the beasts, small with great. Psalm 104:26\tThere the ships will go: the sea monster thou didst form to play in it. Psalm 104:27\tThey will all wait for thee to give their food in its time.

Psalm 105:7\tHe is Jehovah our God: his judgments are in all the earth. Psalm 105:8\tHe remembered his covenant forever, the word he commanded to a thousand generations. Psalm 105:9\tWhich he cut out with Abraham, and his oath to Isaak. Psalm 105:10\tAnd he will set it for a law to Jacob, to Israel an eternal covenant: Psalm 105:11\tSaying, To thee will give the land of Canaan, the line of your inheritance: Psalm 105:12\tIn their being men of number, as few and strangers in it.

Psalm 105:20\tThe king sent and he will bring him down; the ruler of the peoples, and he will loose him. Psalm 105:21\tHe set him lord to his house, and ruler over all his possessions: Psalm 105:22\tTo bind his chiefs in his soul, and to make his old men wise. Psalm 105:23\tAnd Israel will come into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. Psalm 105:24\tAnd he will make his people fruitful greatly, and he will strengthen him above his enemies. Psalm 105:25\tHe turned their heart to hate his people, to act deceitfully with his servants. Psalm 105:26\tHe sent Moses his servant; Aaron whom he chose in him. Psalm 105:27\tThey set the words of his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. Psalm 105:28\tHe sent darkness, and he will darken; and they embittered not his words. Psalm 105:29\tHe turned their waters to blood, and he will slay their fish. Psalm 105:30\tTheir land abounded with frogs in the chambers of their kings. Psalm 105:31\tHe said, and the gad-fly will come, and gnats in all their bounds. Psalm 105:32\tHe gave their rain hail, a fire of flames in their land. Psalm 105:33\tAnd he will strike their vine and their fig trees, and he will break the tree of their bound. Psalm 105:34\tHe said, and the locust will come and the feeder, and no number.

Psalm 105:37\tAnd he will bring them forth with silver and gold, and none being weak in their tribes. Psalm 105:38\tEgypt was glad in their going forth, for their fear fell upon them. Psalm 105:39\tHe spread a cloud for covering, and fire to lighten the night. Psalm 105:40\tAsking, and he will bring the quail, and he will fill them with the bread of the heavens. Psalm 105:41\tHe opened the rock and the waters will flow; they went in dry places a river. Psalm 105:42\tFor he remembered his holy word with Abraham his servant. Psalm 105:43\tAnd he will bring forth his people in joy, his chosen in rejoicing. Psalm 105:44\tAnd he will give to them the lands of the nations, and they will inherit the labor of the people; Psalm 105:45\tSo that they shall watch his laws, and his instructions they shall observe. Praise ye Jah. Psalm 106:1\tPraise Jah. Confess to Jehovah, for he is good, for his mercy is forever. Psalm 106:2\tWho shall speak the powers of Jehovah? will he cause all his praises to be heard? Psalm 106:3\tHappy they watching judgment, doing justice in all time. Psalm 106:4\tRemember us, O Jehovah: thy people with acceptance: review us with thy salvation; Psalm 106:5\tTo see the goodness of thy chosen ones, to be glad in the gladness of thy nation, to boast with thine inheritance. Psalm 106:6\tWe sinned with our fathers, we acted perversely, we did evil. Psalm 106:7\tOur fathers considered not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; they embittered at the sea, the sea of sedge; Psalm 106:8\tAnd he will save them for sake of his name, to make known his powers. Psalm 106:9\tAnd he will rebuke in the sea of sedge, and it will be dried up: and he will lead them in the depths as the desert. Psalm 106:10\tAnd he will save them from the hand of him hating, and he will redeem them from the hand of the enemy. Psalm 106:11\tAnd the waters will cover their enemies: one of them was not left. Psalm 106:12\tAnd they will believe in his words, they will sing his praise. Psalm 106:13\tThey hastened; they forget his works; they waited not for his counsel. Psalm 106:14\tAnd they will desire a desire in the desert, and they will tempt God in the waste. Psalm 106:15\tAnd he will give to them their asking; and he will send leanness into their soul. Psalm 106:16\tAnd they will be jealous against Moses in the camp, against Aaron the holy of Jehovah. Psalm 106:17\tThe earth will open and will swallow down Dathan, and will cover the assembly of Abiram. Psalm 106:18\tAnd a fire will be kindled in their assembly; the flame will burn up the unjust. Psalm 106:19\tThey will make a calf in Horeb, and they will worship to the molten image. Psalm 106:20\tAnd they will change their glory into the likeness of an ox eating grass. Psalm 106:21\tThey forgat God saving them, doing great things in Egypt. Psalm 106:22\tWonders in the land of Ham, terrible things in the sea of sedge. Psalm 106:23\tAnd he will say to destroy them unless Moses his chosen stood in the breaking before him to turn away his wrath from destroying. Psalm 106:24\tAnd they will despise in the land of desire; they trusted not to his word: Psalm 106:25\tAnd they will murmur in their tents; they heard not to the voice of Jehovah. Psalm 106:26\tAnd he will lift up his hand against them: he will cause them to fall in the desert: Psalm 106:27\tAnd to cause their seed to fall among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. Psalm 106:28\tAnd they will be bound to Baalpeor, and they will eat the sacrifices of the dead. Psalm 106:29\tAnd they will irritate in their doings, and the blow will break upon them. Psalm 106:30\tAnd Phinehas will stand and intercede, and the blow will be restrained. Psalm 106:31\tAnd it will be reckoned to him for justice to generation and generation, even to forever. Psalm 106:32\tAnd they will anger him at the water of strife, and it will be evil to Moses on account of them: Psalm 106:33\tFor they embittered his spirit, and he talked idly with his lips. Psalm 106:34\tThey did not destroy the peoples which Jehovah said to them. Psalm 106:35\tAnd they will mingle with the nations, and they will learn their works. Psalm 106:36\tAnd they will serve their images, and they will be for a snare to them. Psalm 106:37\tAnd they will sacrifice their sons and their daughters to lords. Psalm 106:38\tAnd they will pour out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and their daughters which they sacrificed to the images of Canaan: and the land will be polluted with bloods. Psalm 106:39\tAnd they will be defiled with their works: and they will commit fornication in their doings. Psalm 106:40\tAnd the anger of Jehovah will kindle against his people, and he will abhor his inheritance. Psalm 106:41\tAnd he will give them into the hand of the nations; and they hating them shall rule over them. Psalm 106:42\tAnd their enemies will press them, and they shall be humbled under their hand. Psalm 106:43\tMany times he will deliver them, and they will embitter with their counsel, and they will be brought low in their iniquity. Psalm 106:44\tAnd he will look upon straits to them in his hearing their wailing. Psalm 106:45\tAnd he will remember his covenant to them, and he will console according to the multitude of his mercy. Psalm 106:46\tAnd he will give them for compassions before all those carrying them away captive. Psalm 106:47\tSave us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from the nations to confess to thy holy name, to boast in thy praise. Psalm 106:48\tBlessed be Jehovah the God of Israel from forever and even to forever: and all the people saying, Amen. Praise ye Jah. Psalm 107:1\tConfess ye to Jehovah, for he is good, his mercy is forever. Psalm 107:2\tThey being redeemed of Jehovah shall say, Which he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. Psalm 107:3\tAnd he gathered them from the lands, from the sunrisings and from the west, from the north and from the sea. Psalm 107:4\tThey will wander in the desert in a waste; the way of a city of dwelling they found not. Psalm 107:5\tHungering, also thirsting, their soul will faint in them. Psalm 107:6\tAnd they will cry to Jehovah in straits to them, and he will deliver them from their distresses. Psalm 107:7\tAnd he will cause them to tread in a straight way, to go to a city of dwelling. Psalm 107:8\tThey shall confess to Jehovah his mercy, and his wonders to the sons of man. Psalm 107:9\tFor he satisfied the thirsty soul, and the hungering soul he filled with good. Psalm 107:10\tThey sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound with affliction and iron. Psalm 107:11\tFor they embittered the sayings of God, and they despised the counsel of the Most High: Psalm 107:12\tAnd he will humble their heart with labor; they were weak, and none helping.
