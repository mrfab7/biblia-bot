Psalm 1:1\tBlessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the chair of pestilence. Psalm 1:2\tBut his will is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he shall meditate day and night. Psalm 1:3\tAnd he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running waters, which shall bring forth its fruit, in due season. And his leaf shall not fall off: and all whosoever he shall do shall prosper. Psalm 1:4\tNot so the wicked, not so: but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth. Psalm 1:5\tTherefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: nor sinners in the council of the just. Psalm 1:6\tFor the Lord knoweth the way of the just: and the way of the wicked shall perish. Psalm 2:1\tWhy have the Gentiles raged, and the people devised vain things? Psalm 2:2\tThe kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, against the Lord and against his Christ. Psalm 2:3\tLet us break their bonds asunder: and let us cast away their yoke from us. Psalm 2:4\tHe that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: and the Lord shall deride them. Psalm 2:5\tThen shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his rage. Psalm 2:6\tBut I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy mountain, preaching his commandment. Psalm 2:7\tThe Lord hath said to me: Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee. Psalm 2:8\tAsk of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession. Psalm 2:9\tThou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, and shalt break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. Psalm 2:10\tAnd now, O ye kings, understand: receive instruction, you that judge the earth. Psalm 2:11\tServe ye the Lord with fear: and rejoice unto him with trembling. Psalm 2:12\tEmbrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and you perish from the just way. When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, blessed are all they that trust in him. Psalm 3:1\tThe psalm of David when he fled from the face of his son Absalom. Why, O Lord, are they multiplied that afflict me? many are they who rise up against me. Psalm 3:2\tMany say to my soul: There is no salvation for him in his God. Psalm 3:3\tBut thou, O Lord art my protector, my glory, and the lifter up of my head. Psalm 3:4\tI have cried to the Lord with my voice: and he hath heard me from his holy hill. Psalm 3:5\tI have slept and taken my rest: and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me.

Psalm 5:3\tFor to thee will I pray: O Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear my voice. Psalm 5:4\tIn the morning I will stand before thee, and will see: because thou art not a God that willest iniquity. Psalm 5:5\tNeither shall the wicked dwell near thee: nor shall the unjust abide before thy eyes. Psalm 5:6\tThou hatest all the workers of iniquity: Thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie. The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor. Psalm 5:7\tBut as for me in the multitude of thy mercy, I will come into thy house; I will worship towards thy holy temple, in thy fear. Psalm 5:8\tConduct me, O Lord, in thy justice: because of my enemies, direct my way in thy sight. Psalm 5:9\tfor there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain. Psalm 5:10\tTheir throat is an open sepulchre: they dealt deceitfully with their tongues: judge them, O God. Let them fall from their devices: according to the multitude of their wickedness cast them out: for they have provoked thee, O Lord.

Psalm 6:4\tTurn to me, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy’s sake. Psalm 6:5\tFor there is no one in death, that is mindful of thee: and who shall confess to thee in hell? Psalm 6:6\tI have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed: I will water my couch with my tears.

Psalm 7:2\tLest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, while there is no one to redeem me, nor to save. Psalm 7:3\tO Lord my God, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity in my hands: Psalm 7:4\tIf I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, let me deservedly fall empty before my enemies. Psalm 7:5\tLet the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life on the earth, and bring down my glory to the dust. Psalm 7:6\tRise up, O Lord, in thy anger: and be thou exalted in the borders of my enemies.

Psalm 7:9\tThe wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought: and thou shalt direct the just: the searcher of hearts and reins is God. Psalm 7:10\tJust is my help from the Lord: who saveth the upright of heart. Psalm 7:11\tGod is a just judge, strong and patient: is he angry every day? Psalm 7:12\tExcept you will be converted, he will brandish his sword: he hath bent his bow and made it ready. Psalm 7:13\tAnd in it he hath prepared the instruments of death, he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn. Psalm 7:14\tBehold he hath been in labour with injustice; he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity. Psalm 7:15\tHe hath opened a pit and dug it; and he is fallen into the hole he made. Psalm 7:16\tHis sorrow shall be turned on his own head: and his iniquity shall comedown upon his crown.

Psalm 8:3\tFor I will behold thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: the moon and the stars which thou hast founded. Psalm 8:4\tWhat is man that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him? Psalm 8:5\tThou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour: Psalm 8:6\tand hast set him over the works of thy hands. Psalm 8:7\tThou hast subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen: moreover the beasts also of the fields.

Psalm 9:4\tFor thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice. Psalm 9:5\tThou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished: thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. Psalm 9:6\tThe swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a noise. Psalm 9:7\tbut the Lord remaineth for ever. He hath prepared his throne in judgment: Psalm 9:8\tand he shall judge the world in equity, he shall judge the people in justice. Psalm 9:9\tAnd the Lord is become a refuge for the poor: a helper in due time in tribulation.

Psalm 9:15\tI will rejoice in thy salvation: the Gentiles have stuck fast in the destruction which they have prepared. Their foot hath been taken in the very snare which they hid. Psalm 9:16\tThe Lord shall be known when he executeth judgments: the sinner hath been caught in the works of his own hands. Psalm 9:17\tThe wicked shall be turned into hell, all the nations that forget God. Psalm 9:18\tFor the poor man shall not be forgotten to the end: the patience of the poor shall not perish for ever. Psalm 9:19\tArise, O Lord, let not man be strengthened: let the Gentiles be judged in thy sight. Psalm 9:20\tAppoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: that the Gentiles may know themselves to be but men. Psalm 10:1\tWhy, O Lord, hast thou retired afar off? why dost thou slight us in our wants, in the time of trouble? Psalm 10:2\tWhilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: they are caught in the counsels which they devise. Psalm 10:3\tFor the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: and the unjust man is blessed. Psalm 10:4\tThe sinner hath provoked the Lord according to the multitude of his wrath he will not seek him: Psalm 10:5\tGod is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all times. Thy judgments are removed from his sight: he shall rule over all his enemies. Psalm 10:6\tFor he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil. Psalm 10:7\tHis mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deceit: under his tongue are labour and sorrow. Psalm 10:8\tHe sitteth in ambush with the rich in private places, that he may kill the innocent. Psalm 10:9\tHis eyes are upon the poor man: He lieth in wait in secret like a lion in his den. He lieth in ambush that he may catch the poor man: to catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him. Psalm 10:10\tIn his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor. Psalm 10:11\tFor he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face not to see to the end. Psalm 10:12\tArise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor. Psalm 10:13\tWherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his heart: He will not require it. Psalm 10:14\tThou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor man left: thou wilt be a helper to the orphan. Psalm 10:15\tBreak thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found.

In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: Get thee away from hence to the mountain like a sparrow? Psalm 11:2\tFor, lo, the wicked have bent their bow; they have prepared their arrows in the quiver; to shoot in the dark the upright of heart. Psalm 11:3\tFor they have destroyed the things which thou hast made: but what has the just man done? Psalm 11:4\tThe Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord’s throne is in heaven. His eyes look on the poor man: his eyelids examine the sons of men. Psalm 11:5\tThe Lord trieth the just and the wicked: but he that loveth iniquity hateth his own soul. Psalm 11:6\tHe shall rain snares upon sinners: fire and brimstone and storms of winds shall be the portion of their cup. Psalm 11:7\tFor the Lord is just, and hath loved justice: his countenance hath beheld righteousness. Psalm 12:1\tUnto the end; for the octave, a psalm for David. Save me, O Lord, for there is now no saint: truths are decayed from among the children of men. Psalm 12:2\tThey have spoken vain things every one to his neighbour: with deceitful lips, and with a double heart have they spoken. Psalm 12:3\tMay the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things. Psalm 12:4\tWho have said: We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? Psalm 12:5\tBy reason of the misery of the needy, and the groans of the poor, now will I arise, saith the Lord. I win set him in safety; I will deal confidently in his regard. Psalm 12:6\tThe words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried by the fire, purged from the earth refined seven times. Psalm 12:7\tThou, O Lord, wilt preserve us.: and keep us from this generation for ever. Psalm 12:8\tThe wicked walk round about: according to thy highness, thou best multiplied the children of men. Psalm 13:1\tUnto the end, a psalm for David. How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me unto the end? how long dost thou turn away thy face from me? Psalm 13:2\tHow long shall I take counsels in my soul, sorrow in my heart all the day? Psalm 13:3\tHow long shall my enemy be exalted over me? Psalm 13:4\tConsider, and hear me, O Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes that I never sleep in death: Psalm 13:5\tlest at any time my enemy say: I have prevailed against him. They that trouble me will rejoice when I am moved: Psalm 13:6\tbut I have trusted in thy mercy. My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation: I will sing to the Lord, who giveth me good things: yea I will sing to the name of the Lord the most high. Psalm 14:1\tUnto the end, a psalm for David. The fool hath said in his heart: There is no God, They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: there is none that doth good, no not one. Psalm 14:2\tThe Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God. Psalm 14:3\tThey are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they acted deceitfully; the poison of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and unhappiness in their ways: and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes. Psalm 14:4\tShall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people as they eat bread ? Psalm 14:5\tThey have not called upon the Lord: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear. Psalm 14:6\tFor the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man, but the Lord is his hope. Psalm 14:7\tWho shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad. Psalm 15:1\tA psalm of David. Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? or who shall rest in thy holy hill? Psalm 15:2\tHe that walketh without blemish, and worketh justice: Psalm 15:3\tHe that speaketh truth in his heart, who hath not used deceit in his tongue: Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours. Psalm 15:4\tIn his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not; Psalm 15:5\the that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent: He that doth these things shall not be moved for ever. Psalm 16:1\tThe inscription of a title to David himself. Preserve me, O Lord, for I have put trust in thee. Psalm 16:2\tI have said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need of my goods. Psalm 16:3\tTo the saints, who are in his land, he hath made wonderful all my desires in them. Psalm 16:4\tTheir infirmities were multiplied: afterwards they made haste. I will not gather together their meetings for blood offerings: nor will I be mindful of their names by my lips. Psalm 16:5\tThe Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: it is thou that wilt restore my inheritance to me. Psalm 16:6\tThe lines are fallen unto me in goodly places: for my inheritance is goodly to me. Psalm 16:7\tI will bless the Lord, who hath given me understanding: moreover my reins also have corrected me even till night. Psalm 16:8\tI set the Lord always in my sight: for he is at my right hand, that I be not moved. Psalm 16:9\tTherefore my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced: moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope. Psalm 16:10\tBecause thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; nor wilt then give thy holy one to see corruption. Psalm 16:11\tThou hast made known to me the ways of life, thou shalt fill me with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand are delights even to the end. Psalm 17:1\tThe prayer of David. Hear, O Lord, my justice: attend to my supplication. Give ear unto my prayer, which proceedeth not from deceitful lips. Psalm 17:2\tLet my judgment come forth from thy countenance: let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable. Psalm 17:3\tThou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me. Psalm 17:4\tThat my mouth may not speak the works of men: for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways. Psalm 17:5\tPerfect thou my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps be not moved. Psalm 17:6\tI have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words. Psalm 17:7\tShew forth thy wonderful mercies; thou who savest them that trust in thee. Psalm 17:8\tFrom them that resist thy right hand keep me, as the apple of thy eye. Protect me under the shadow of thy wings. Psalm 17:9\tFrom the face of the wicked who have afflicted me. My enemies have surrounded my soul: Psalm 17:10\tthey have shut up their fat: their mouth hath spoken proudly. Psalm 17:11\tThey have cast me forth and now they have surrounded me: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth. Psalm 17:12\tThey have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; and as a young lion dwelling in secret places. Psalm 17:13\tArise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; deliver my soul from the wicked one: thy sword Psalm 17:14\tfrom the enemies of thy hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: their belly is filled from thy hidden stores. They are full of children: and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance. Psalm 17:15\tBut as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear. Psalm 18:1\tUnto the end, for David the servant of the Lord, who spoke to the Lord the words of this canticle, in the day that the Lord delivered him from the hands of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. [2 Kings 22.] I will love thee, O Lord, my strength: Psalm 18:2\tThe Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my deliverer. My God is my helper, and in him will I put my trust. My protector and the horn of my salvation, and my support. Psalm 18:3\tPraising I will call upon the Lord: and I shall be saved from my enemies. Psalm 18:4\tThe sorrows of death surrounded me: and the torrents of iniquity troubled me. Psalm 18:5\tThe sorrows of hell encompassed me: and the snares of death prevented me. Psalm 18:6\tIn my affliction I called upon the Lord, and I cried to my God: And he heard my voice from his holy temple: and my cry before him came into his ears. Psalm 18:7\tThe earth shook and trembled: the foundations of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with them. Psalm 18:8\tThere went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed from his face: coals were kindled by it. Psalm 18:9\tHe bowed the heavens, and came down: and darkness was under his feet. Psalm 18:10\tAnd he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; he flew upon the wings of the winds. Psalm 18:11\tAnd he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about him: dark waters in the clouds of the air. Psalm 18:12\tAt the brightness that was before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire. Psalm 18:13\tAnd the Lord thundered from heaven, and the highest gave his voice: hail and coals of fire. Psalm 18:14\tAnd he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: he multiplied lightnings, and troubled them. Psalm 18:15\tThen the fountains of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were discovered: At thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the spirit of thy wrath. Psalm 18:16\tHe sent from on high, and took me: and received me out of many waters. Psalm 18:17\tHe delivered me from my strongest enemies, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me. Psalm 18:18\tThey prevented me in the day of my affliction: and the Lord became my protector. Psalm 18:19\tAnd he brought me forth into a large place: he saved me, because he was well pleased with me. Psalm 18:20\tAnd the Lord will reward me according to my justice; and will repay me according to the cleanness of my hands: Psalm 18:21\tBecause I have kept the ways of the Lord; and have not done wickedly against my God.

Psalm 33:14\tFrom his habitation which he hath prepared, he hath looked upon all that dwell on the earth. Psalm 33:15\tHe who hath made the hearts of every one of them: who understandeth all their works. Psalm 33:16\tThe king is not saved by a great army: nor shall the giant be saved by his own great strength. Psalm 33:17\tVain is the horse for safety: neither shall he be saved by the abundance of his strength. Psalm 33:18\tBehold the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him: and on them that hope in his mercy. Psalm 33:19\tTo deliver their souls from death; and feed them in famine. Psalm 33:20\tOur soul waiteth for the Lord: for he is our helper and protector. Psalm 33:21\tFor in him our heart shall rejoice: and in his holy name we have trusted. Psalm 33:22\tLet thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, as we have hoped in thee. Psalm 34:1\tFor David, when he changed his countenance before Achimelech, who dismissed him, and he went his way. [1 Kings 21.] I will bless the Lord at all times, his praise shall be always in my mouth. Psalm 34:2\tIn the Lord shall my soul be praised: let the meek hear and rejoice. Psalm 34:3\tO magnify the Lord with me; and let us extol his name together. Psalm 34:4\tI sought the Lord, and he heard me; and he delivered me from all my troubles. Psalm 34:5\tCome ye to him and be enlightened: and your faces shall not be confounded. Psalm 34:6\tThis poor man cried, and the Lord heard him: and saved him out of all his troubles. Psalm 34:7\tThe angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear him: and shall deliver them. Psalm 34:8\tO taste, and see that the Lord is sweet: blessed is the man that hopeth in him. Psalm 34:9\tFear the Lord, all ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. Psalm 34:10\tThe rich have wanted, and have suffered hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good. Psalm 34:11\tCome, children, hearken to me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Psalm 34:12\tWho is the man that desireth life: who loveth to see good days? Psalm 34:13\tKeep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Psalm 34:14\tTurn away from evil and do good: seek after peace and pursue it. Psalm 34:15\tThe eyes of the Lord are upon the just: and his ears unto their prayers. Psalm 34:16\tBut the countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil things: to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. Psalm 34:17\tThe just cried, and the Lord heard them: and delivered them out of all their troubles. Psalm 34:18\tThe Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and he will save the humble of spirit. Psalm 34:19\tMany are the afflictions of the just; but out of them all will the Lord deliver them. Psalm 34:20\tThe Lord keepeth all their bones, not one of them shall be broken. Psalm 34:21\tThe death of the wicked is very evil: and they that hate the just shall be guilty. Psalm 34:22\tThe Lord will redeem the souls of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall offend. Psalm 35:1\tFor David himself. Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me : overthrow them that fight against me. Psalm 35:2\tTake hold of arms and shield : and rise up to help me. Psalm 35:3\tBring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me : say to my soul : I am thy salvation. Psalm 35:4\tLet them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul. Let them be turned back and be confounded that devise against me. Psalm 35:5\tLet them become as dust before the wind : and let the angel of the Lord straiten them. Psalm 35:6\tLet their way become dark and slippery; and let the angel of the Lord pursue them. Psalm 35:7\tFor without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction : without cause they have upbraided my soul. Psalm 35:8\tLet the snare which he knoweth not come upon him : and let the net which he hath hidden catch him : and let the net which he hath hidden catch him : and into that very snare let them fall. Psalm 35:9\tBut my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; and shall be delighted in his salvation. Psalm 35:10\tAll my bones shall say : Lord, who is like to thee? Who deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; the needy and the poor from them that strip him. Psalm 35:11\tUnjust witnesses rising up have asked me things I knew not. Psalm 35:12\tThey repaid me evil for good : to the depriving me of my soul. Psalm 35:13\tBut as for me, when they were troublesome to me, I was clothed with haircloth. I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom. Psalm 35:14\tAs a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please : as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled. Psalm 35:15\tBut they rejoiced against me, and came together : scourges were gathered together upon me, and I knew not. Psalm 35:16\tThey were separated, and repented not : they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn : they gnashed upon me with their teeth. Psalm 35:17\tLord, when wilt thou look upon me? rescue thou soul from their malice : my only one from the lions. Psalm 35:18\tI will give thanks to thee in a great church; I will praise thee in a strong people. Psalm 35:19\tLet not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me : who have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes. Psalm 35:20\tFor they spoke indeed peaceably to me; and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile. Psalm 35:21\tAnd they opened their mouth wide against me; they said : Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it. Psalm 35:22\tThou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent : O Lord, depart not from me. Psalm 35:23\tArise, and be attentive to my judgment : to my cause, my God, and my Lord. Psalm 35:24\tJudge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, and let them not rejoice over me. Psalm 35:25\tLet them not say in their hearts : It is well, it is well, to our mind : neither let them say : We have swallowed him up. Psalm 35:26\tLet them blush : and be ashamed together, who rejoice at my evils. Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, who speak great things against me. Psalm 35:27\tLet them rejoice and be glad, who are well pleased with my justice, and let them say always : The Lord be magnified, who delights in the peace of his servant. Psalm 35:28\tAny my tongue shall meditate thy justice, thy praise all the day long. Psalm 36:1\tUnto the end, for the servant of God, David himself. The unjust hath said within himself, that he would sin : there is no fear of God before his eyes. Psalm 36:2\tFor in his sight he hath done deceitfully, that his iniquity may be found unto hatred. Psalm 36:3\tThe words of his mouth are iniquity and guile : he would not understand that he might do well. Psalm 36:4\tHe hath devised iniquity on his bed, he hath set himself on every way that is not good : but evil he hath not hated. Psalm 36:5\tO Lord, thy mercy is in heaven, and thy truth reacheth, even to the clouds. Psalm 36:6\tThy justice is as the mountains of God, thy judgments are a great deep. Men and beasts thou wilt preserve, O Lord : Psalm 36:7\tO how hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God! But the children of men shall put their trust under the covert of thy wings. Psalm 36:8\tThey shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure. Psalm 36:9\tFor with thee is the fountain of life; and in thy light we shall see light. Psalm 36:10\tExtend thy mercy to them that know thee, and thy justice to them that are right in heart. Psalm 36:11\tLet not the foot of pride come to me, and let not the hand of the sinner move me. Psalm 36:12\tThere the workers of iniquity are fallen, they are cast out, and could not stand. Psalm 37:1\tA psalm for David himself. Be not emulous of evildoers; nor envy them that work iniquity. Psalm 37:2\tFor they shall shortly wither away as grass, and as the green herbs shall quickly fall. Psalm 37:3\tTrust in the Lord, and do good, and dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed with its riches. Psalm 37:4\tDelight in the Lord, and he will give thee the requests of thy heart. Psalm 37:5\tCommit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, and he will do it. Psalm 37:6\tAnd he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. Psalm 37:7\tBe subject to the Lord and pray to him Envy not the man who prospereth in his way; the man who doth unjust things. Psalm 37:8\tCease from anger, and leave rage; have no emulation to do evil. Psalm 37:9\tFor the evildoers shall be cut off : but they that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the land. Psalm 37:10\tFor yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be : and thou shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it. Psalm 37:11\tBut the meek shall inherit the land, and shall delight in abundance of peace. Psalm 37:12\tThe sinner shall watch the just man : and shall gnash upon him with his teeth. Psalm 37:13\tBut the Lord shall laugh at him : for he foreseeth that his day shall come. Psalm 37:14\tThe wicked have drawn out the sword : they have bent their bow. To cast down the poor and needy, to kill the upright of heart. Psalm 37:15\tLet their sword enter into their own hearts, and let their bow be broken. Psalm 37:16\tBetter is a little to the just, than the great riches of the wicked. Psalm 37:17\tFor the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces; but the Lord strengtheneth the just. Psalm 37:18\tThe Lord knoweth the days of undefiled; and their inheritance shall be for ever. Psalm 37:19\tThey shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be filled : Psalm 37:20\tbecause the wicked shall perish. And the enemies of the Lord, presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, shall come to nothing and vanish like smoke. Psalm 37:21\tThe sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; but the just sheweth mercy and shall give. Psalm 37:22\tFor such as bless him shall inherit the land : but such as curse him shall perish. Psalm 37:23\tWith the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, and he shall like well his way. Psalm 37:24\tWhen he shall fall he shall not be bruised, for the Lord putteth his hand under him. Psalm 37:25\tI have been young, and now am old; and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread. Psalm 37:26\tHe sheweth mercy, and lendeth all the day long; and his seed shall be in blessing. Psalm 37:27\tDecline from evil and do good, and dwell for ever and ever. Psalm 37:28\tFor the Lord loveth judgment, and will not forsake his saints : they shall be preserved for ever. The unjust shall be punished, and the seed of the wicked shall perish. Psalm 37:29\tBut the just shall inherit the land, and shall dwell therein for evermore. Psalm 37:30\tThe mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom : and his tongue shall speak judgment. Psalm 37:31\tThe law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be supplanted. Psalm 37:32\tThe wicked watcheth the just man, and seeketh to put him to death, Psalm 37:33\tBut the Lord will not leave in his hands; nor condemn him when he shall be judged. Psalm 37:34\tExpect the Lord and keep his way : and he will exalt thee to inherit the land : when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see. Psalm 37:35\tI have seen the wicked highly exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of Libanus. Psalm 37:36\tAnd I passed by, and lo, he was not : and I sought him and his place was not found. Psalm 37:37\tKeep innocence, and behold justice : for there are remnants for the peaceable man. Psalm 37:38\tBut the unjust shall be destroyed together : the remnants of the wicked shall perish. Psalm 37:39\tBut the salvation of the just is from the Lord, and he is their protector in the time of trouble. Psalm 37:40\tAnd the Lord will help them and deliver them : and he will rescue them from the wicked, and save them, because they have hoped in him. Psalm 38:1\tA psalm for David, for a remembrance of the sabbath. Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; nor chastise me in thy wrath. Psalm 38:2\tFor thy arrows are fastened in me : and thy hand hath been strong upon me. Psalm 38:3\tThere is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath : there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins. Psalm 38:4\tFor my iniquities are gone over my head : and as a heavy burden are become heavy upon me. Psalm 38:5\tMy sores are putrified and corrupted, because of my foolishness. Psalm 38:6\tI am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end : I walked sorrowful all the day long. Psalm 38:7\tFor my loins are filled with illusions; and there is no health in my flesh. Psalm 38:8\tI am afflicted and humbled exceedingly : I roared with the groaning of my heart. Psalm 38:9\tLord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hidden from thee. Psalm 38:10\tMy heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, and the light of my eyes itself is not with me. Psalm 38:11\tMy friends and my neighbours have drawn near, and stood against me. And they that were near me stood afar off : Psalm 38:12\tAnd they that sought my soul used violence. And they that sought evils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the day long. Psalm 38:13\tBut I, as a deaf man, heard not : and as a dumb man not opening his mouth. Psalm 38:14\tAnd I became as a man that heareth not : and that hath no reproofs in his mouth. Psalm 38:15\tFor in thee, O Lord, have I hoped : thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God. Psalm 38:16\tFor I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me : and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me. Psalm 38:17\tFor I am ready for scourges : and my sorrow is continually before me. Psalm 38:18\tFor I will declare my inequity : and I will think for my sin. Psalm 38:19\tBut my enemies live, and are stronger that I : and they hate me wrongfully are multiplied. Psalm 38:20\tThey that render evil for good, have detracted me, because I followed goodness. Psalm 38:21\tForsake me not, O Lord my God : do not thou depart from me. Psalm 38:22\tAttend unto my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation. Psalm 39:1\tUnto the end, for Idithun himself, a canticle of David. I said: I will take heed to my ways : that I sin not with my tongue. I have set guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against me. Psalm 39:2\tI was dumb, and was humbled, and kept silence from good things : and my sorrow was renewed. Psalm 39:3\tMy heart grew hot within me : and in my meditation a fire shall flame out. Psalm 39:4\tI spoke with my tongue : O Lord, make me know my end. And what is the number of my days : that I may know what is wanting to me. Psalm 39:5\tBehold thou hast made my days measurable : and my substance is as nothing before thee. And indeed all things are vanity : every man living. Psalm 39:6\tSurely man passeth as an image : yea, and he is disquieted in vain. He storeth up : and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these things. Psalm 39:7\tAnd now what is my hope? is it not the Lord? and my substance is with thee. Psalm 39:8\tDeliver thou me from all my iniquities : thou hast made me a reproach to the fool. Psalm 39:9\tI was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it. Psalm 39:10\tRemove thy scourges from me. The strength of thy hand hath made me faint in rebukes: Psalm 39:11\tthou hast corrected man for iniquity. And thou hast made his soul to waste away like a spider : surely in vain is any man disquieted. Psalm 39:12\tHear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication : give ear to my tears. Be not silent : for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as all my fathers were. Psalm 39:13\tO forgive me, that I may be refreshed, before I go hence, and be no more. Psalm 40:1\tUnto the end, a psalm for David himself. With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive to me. Psalm 40:2\tAnd he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs. And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my steps. Psalm 40:3\tAnd he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many shall see, and shall fear : and they shall hope in the Lord. Psalm 40:4\tBlessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; and who hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies. Psalm 40:5\tThou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God : and in thy thoughts there is no one like to thee. I have declared and I have spoken they are multiplied above number. Psalm 40:6\tSacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; but thou hast pierced ears for me. Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not require : Psalm 40:7\tthen said I, Behold I come. In the head of the book it is written of me Psalm 40:8\tthat I should do thy will : O my God, I have desired it, and thy law in the midst of my heart. Psalm 40:9\tI have declared thy justice in a great church, lo, I will not restrain my lips : O Lord, thou knowest it. Psalm 40:10\tI have not hid thy justice within my heart : I have declared thy truth and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth from a great council. Psalm 40:11\tWithhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me : thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me. Psalm 40:12\tFor evils without number have surrounded me; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see. They are multiplied above the hairs of my head : and my heart hath forsaken me. Psalm 40:13\tBe pleased, O Lord, to deliver me, look down, O Lord, to help me. Psalm 40:14\tLet them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek after my soul to take it away. Let them be turned backward and be ashamed that desire evils to me. Psalm 40:15\tLet them immediately bear their confusion, that say to me : ‘T is well, ‘t is well. Psalm 40:16\tLet all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : and let such as love thy salvation say always : The Lord be magnified. Psalm 40:17\tBut I am a beggar and poor : the Lord is careful for me. Thou art my helper and my protector : O my God, be not slack. Psalm 41:1\tUnto the end, a psalm for David himself. Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the poor : the Lord will deliver him in the evil day. Psalm 41:2\tThe Lord preserve him and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth : and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies. Psalm 41:3\tThe Lord help him on his bed of sorrow : thou hast turned all his couch in his sickness. Psalm 41:4\tI said: O Lord, be thou merciful to me : heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee. Psalm 41:5\tMy enemies have spoken evils against me: when shall he die and his name perish? Psalm 41:6\tAnd if he came in to see me, he spoke vain things : his heart gathered together iniquity to itself. He went out and spoke to the same purpose. Psalm 41:7\tAll my enemies whispered together against me : they devised evils to me. Psalm 41:8\tThey determined against me an unjust word : shall he that sleepeth rise again no more? Psalm 41:9\tFor even the man of peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, hath greatly supplanted me. Psalm 41:10\tBut thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up again : and I will requite them. Psalm 41:11\tBy this I know, that thou hast had a good will for me : because my enemy shall not rejoice over me. Psalm 41:12\tBut thou hast upheld me by reason of my innocence : and hast established me in thy sight for ever. Psalm 41:13\tBlessed by the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity. So be it. So be it. Psalm 42:1\tUnto the end, understanding for the sons of Core. As the hart panteth after the fountains of water; so my soul panteth after thee, O God. Psalm 42:2\tMy soul hath thirsted after the strong living God; when shall I come and appear before the face of God? Psalm 42:3\tMy tears have been any bread day and night, whilst it is said to me daily : Where is thy God? Psalm 42:4\tThese things I remembered, and poured out my soul in me : for I shall go over into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even to the house of God : With the voice of joy and praise; the noise of one feasting. Psalm 42:5\tWhy art thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou trouble me? Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him : the salvation of my countenance, Psalm 42:6\tand my God. My soul is troubled within myself : therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermoniim, from the little hill. Psalm 42:7\tDeep calleth on deep, at the noise of thy flood-gates. All thy heights and thy billows have passed over me. Psalm 42:8\tIn the daytime the Lord hath commanded his mercy; and a canticle to him in the night. With me is prayer to the God of my life. Psalm 42:9\tI will say to God : Thou art my support. Why hast thou forgotten me? and why go I mourning, whilst my enemy afflicteth me? Psalm 42:10\tWhilst my bones are broken, my enemies who trouble me have reproached me; Whilst they say to me day be day : Where is thy God? Psalm 42:11\tWhy art thou cast down, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I will still give praise to him : the salvation of my countenance, and my God. Psalm 43:1\tA psalm for David. Judge me, O God, and distinguish my cause from the nation that is not holy : deliver me from the unjust and deceitful man. Psalm 43:2\tFor thou art God my strength : why hast thou cast me off? and why do I go sorrowful whilst the enemy afflicteth me? Psalm 43:3\tSend forth thy light and thy truth : they have conducted me, and brought me unto thy holy hill, and into thy tabernacles. Psalm 43:4\tAnd I will go in to the altar of God : to God who giveth joy to my youth. Psalm 43:5\tTo thee, O God my God, I will give praise upon the harp : why art thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him : the salvation of my countenance, and my God. Psalm 44:1\tUnto the end, for the sons of Core, to give understanding. We have heard, O God, with our ears : our fathers have declared to us, The work, thou hast wrought in their days, and in the days of old. Psalm 44:2\tThy hand destroyed the Gentiles, and thou plantedst them : thou didst afflict the people and cast them out. Psalm 44:3\tFor they got not the possession of the land by their own sword : neither did their own arm save them. But thy right hand and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance : because thou wast pleased with them. Psalm 44:4\tThou art thyself my king and my God, who commandest the saving of Jacob. Psalm 44:5\tThrough thee we will push down our enemies with the horn : and through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us. Psalm 44:6\tFor I will not trust in my bow : neither shall my sword save me. Psalm 44:7\tBut thou hast saved us from them that afflict us : and hast put them to shame that hate us. Psalm 44:8\tIn God shall we glory all the day long : and in thy name we will give praise for ever. Psalm 44:9\tBut now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame : and thou, O God, wilt not go out with our armies. Psalm 44:10\tThou hast made us turn our back to our enemies : and they that hated us plundered for themselves. Psalm 44:11\tThou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten : thou hast scattered us among the nations. Psalm 44:12\tThou hast sold thy people for no price : and there was no reckoning in the exchange of them. Psalm 44:13\tThou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scoff and derision to them that are round about us. Psalm 44:14\tThou hast made us a byword among the Gentiles : a shaking of the head among the people. Psalm 44:15\tAll the day long my shame is before me : and the confusion of my face hath covered me, Psalm 44:16\tAt the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me : at the face of the enemy and persecutor. Psalm 44:17\tAll these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee : and we have not done wickedly in they covenant. Psalm 44:18\tAnd our heart hath not turned back : neither hast thou turned aside our steps from thy way. Psalm 44:19\tFor thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction : and the shadow of death hath covered us. Psalm 44:20\tIf we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread forth our hands to a strange god : Psalm 44:21\tShall not God search out these things : for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long : we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Psalm 44:22\tShall not God search out these things : for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long : we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Psalm 44:23\tArise, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, and cast us not off to the end. Psalm 44:24\tWhy turnest thou face away? and forgettest our want and our trouble? Psalm 44:25\tFor our soul is humbled down to the dust : our belly cleaveth to the earth. Psalm 44:26\tArise, O Lord, help us and redeem us for thy name’s sake. Psalm 45:1\tUnto the end, for them that shall be changed, for the sons of Core, for understanding. A canticle for the Beloved. My heart hath uttered a good word I speak my works to the king; My tongue is the pen of a scrivener that writeth swiftly. Psalm 45:2\tThou art beautiful above the sons of men: grace is poured abroad in thy lips; therefore hath God blessed thee for ever Psalm 45:3\tGird thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most mighty. Psalm 45:4\tWith thy comeliness and thy beauty set out, proceed prosperously, and reign. Because of truth and meekness and justice: and thy right hand shall conduct thee wonderfully. Psalm 45:5\tThy arrows are sharp: under thee shall people fall, into the hearts of the king’s enemies. Psalm 45:6\tThy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness. Psalm 45:7\tThou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. Psalm 45:8\tMyrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory houses: out of which Psalm 45:9\tthe daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory. The queen stood on thy right hand, in gilded clothing; surrounded with variety. Psalm 45:10\tHearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thy ear: and forget thy people and thy father’s house. Psalm 45:11\tAnd the king shall greatly desire thy beauty; for he is the Lord thy God, and him they shall adore. Psalm 45:12\tAnd the daughters of Tyre with gifts, yea, all the rich among the people, shall entreat thy countenance. Psalm 45:13\tAll the glory of the king’s daughter is within in golden borders, Psalm 45:14\tclothed round about with varieties. After her shall virgins be brought to the king: her neighbours shall be brought to thee. Psalm 45:15\tThey shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing: they shall be brought into the temple of the king. Psalm 45:16\tInstead of thy fathers, sons are born to thee: thou shalt make them princes over all the earth. Psalm 45:17\tThey shall remember thy name throughout all generations. Therefore shall people praise thee for ever; yea, for ever and ever. Psalm 46:1\tUnto the end, for the sons of Core, for the hidden. Our God is our refuge and strength: a helper in troubles, which have found us exceedingly. Psalm 46:2\tTherefore we will not fear, when the earth shall be troubled; and the mountains shall be removed into the heart of the sea.

Psalm 69:21\tAnd they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. Psalm 69:22\tLet their table become as a snare before them, and a recompense, and a stumblingblock. Psalm 69:23\tLet their eyes be darkened that they see not; and their back bend thou down always. Psalm 69:24\tPour out thy indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. Psalm 69:25\tLet their habitation be made desolate: and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles.

Psalm 73:1\tA psalm for Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to them that are of a right heart! Psalm 73:2\tBut my feet were almost moved; my steps had well nigh slipped. Psalm 73:3\tBecause I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the prosperity of sinners. Psalm 73:4\tFor there is no regard to their death, nor is there strength in their stripes. Psalm 73:5\tThey are not in the labour of men: neither shall they be scourged like other men. Psalm 73:6\tTherefore pride hath held them fast: they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness. Psalm 73:7\tTheir iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness: they have passed into the affection of the heart. Psalm 73:8\tThey have thought and spoken wickedness: they have spoken iniquity on high. Psalm 73:9\tThey have set their mouth against heaven: and their tongue hath passed through the earth. Psalm 73:10\tTherefore will my people return here and full days shall be found in them. Psalm 73:11\tAnd they said: How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High? Psalm 73:12\tBehold these are sinners; and yet abounding in the world they have obtained riches. Psalm 73:13\tAnd I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed my hands among the innocent. Psalm 73:14\tAnd I have been scourged all the day; and my chastisement hath been in the mornings. Psalm 73:15\tIf I said: I will speak thus; behold I should condemn the generation of thy children. Psalm 73:16\tI studied that I might know this thing, it is a labour in my sight: Psalm 73:17\tUntil I go into the sanctuary of God, and understand concerning their last ends. Psalm 73:18\tBut indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them: when they were lifted up thou hast cast them down. Psalm 73:19\tHow are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to be: they have perished by reason of their iniquity. Psalm 73:20\tAs the dream of them that awake, O Lord; so in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing. Psalm 73:21\tFor my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed: Psalm 73:22\tand I am brought to nothing, and I knew not. Psalm 73:23\tI am become as a beast before thee: and I am always with thee. Psalm 73:24\tThou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast conducted me, and with thy glory thou hast received me. Psalm 73:25\tFor what have I in heaven? and besides thee what do I desire upon earth? Psalm 73:26\tFor thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever. Psalm 73:27\tFor behold they that go far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee. Psalm 73:28\tBut it is good for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the Lord God: That I may declare all thy praises, in the gates of the daughter of Sion. Psalm 74:1\tUnderstanding for Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off unto the end: why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture? Psalm 74:2\tRemember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the beginning. The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt. Psalm 74:3\tLift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. Psalm 74:4\tAnd they that hate thee have made their boasts, in the midst of thy solemnity. They have set up their ensigns for signs, Psalm 74:5\tand they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top. As with axes in a wood of trees, Psalm 74:6\tthey have cut down at once the gates thereof, with axe and hatchet they have brought it down. Psalm 74:7\tThey have set fire to thy sanctuary: they have defiled the dwelling place of thy name on the earth. Psalm 74:8\tThey said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: Let us abolish all the festival days of God from the land. Psalm 74:9\tOur signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet: and he will know us no more. Psalm 74:10\tHow long, O God, shall the enemy reproach: is the adversary to provoke thy name for ever? Psalm 74:11\tWhy dost thou turn away thy hand: and thy right hand out of the midst of thy bosom for ever ? Psalm 74:12\tBut God is our king before ages: he hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth. Psalm 74:13\tThou by thy strength didst make the sea firm: thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters. Psalm 74:14\tThou hast broken the heads of the dragon: thou hast given him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians. Psalm 74:15\tThou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents: thou hast dried up the Ethan rivers. Psalm 74:16\tThine is the day, and thine is the night: thou hast made the morning light and the sun. Psalm 74:17\tThou hast made all the borders of the earth: the summer and the spring were formed by thee. Psalm 74:18\tRemember this, the enemy hath reproached the Lord: and a foolish people hath provoked thy name. Psalm 74:19\tDeliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee: and forget not to the end the souls of thy poor. Psalm 74:20\tHave regard to thy covenant: for they that are the obscure of the earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity. Psalm 74:21\tLet not the humble be turned away with confusion: the poor and needy shall praise thy name. Psalm 74:22\tArise, O God, judge thy own cause: remember thy reproaches with which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day. Psalm 74:23\tForget not the voices of thy enemies: the pride of them that hate thee ascendeth continually. Psalm 75:1\tUnto the end, corrupt not, a psalm of a canticle for Asaph. We will praise thee, O God: we will praise, and we will call upon thy name. We will relate thy wondrous works: Psalm 75:2\twhen I shall take a time, I will judge justices. Psalm 75:3\tThe earth is melted, and all that dwell therein: I have established the pillars thereof. Psalm 75:4\tI said to the wicked: Do not act wickedly: and to the sinners: Lift not up the horn. Psalm 75:5\tLift not up your horn on high: speak not iniquity against God. Psalm 75:6\tFor neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert hills: Psalm 75:7\tfor God is the judge. One he putteth down, and another he lifteth up: Psalm 75:8\tfor in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of mixture. And he hath poured it out from this to that: but the dregs thereof are not emptied: all the sinners of the earth shall drink. Psalm 75:9\tBut I will declare for ever: I will sing to the God of Jacob. Psalm 75:10\tAnd I will break all the horns of sinners: but the horns of the just shall be exalted. Psalm 76:1\tUnto the end, in praises, a psalm for Asaph: a canticle to the Assyrians. In Judea God is known: his name is great in Israel. Psalm 76:2\tAnd his place is in peace: and his abode in Sion: Psalm 76:3\tThere hath he broken the powers of bows, the shield, the sword, and the battie. Psalm 76:4\tThou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills. Psalm 76:5\tAll the foolish of heart were troubled. They have slept their sleep; and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands. Psalm 76:6\tAt thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that mounted on horseback. Psalm 76:7\tThou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? from that time thy wrath. Psalm 76:8\tThou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled and was still, Psalm 76:9\tWhen God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Psalm 76:10\tFor the thought of man shall give praise to thee: and the remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee. Psalm 76:11\tVow ye, and pay to the Lord your God: all you that are round about him bring presents. To him that is terrible, Psalm 76:12\teven to him who taketh away the spirit of princes: to the terrible with the kings of the earth. Psalm 77:1\tUnto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph. I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me. Psalm 77:2\tIn the day of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be comforted: Psalm 77:3\tI remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away. Psalm 77:4\tMy eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled, and I spoke not. Psalm 77:5\tI thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the eternal years. Psalm 77:6\tAnd I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was exercised and I swept my spirit. Psalm 77:7\tWill God then cast off for ever? or will he never be more favourable again? Psalm 77:8\tOr will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to generation? Psalm 77:9\tOr will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger shut up his mercies? Psalm 77:10\tAnd I said, Now have I begun: this is the change of the right hand of the most High. Psalm 77:11\tI remembered the works of the Lord: for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning. Psalm 77:12\tAnd I will meditate on all thy works: and will be employed in thy inventions. Psalm 77:13\tThy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like our God? Psalm 77:14\tThou art the God that dost wonders. Thou hast made thy power known among the nations: Psalm 77:15\twith thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob and of Joseph. Psalm 77:16\tThe waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled. Psalm 77:17\tGreat was the noise of the waters: the clouds sent out a sound. For thy arrows pass: Psalm 77:18\tthe voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings enlightened the world: the earth shook and trembled. Psalm 77:19\tThy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and thy footsteps shall not be known. Psalm 77:20\tThou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron Psalm 78:1\tUnderstanding for Asaph. Attend, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. Psalm 78:2\tI will open my mouth in parables: I will utter propositions from the beginning. Psalm 78:3\tHow great things have we heard and known, and our fathers have told us. Psalm 78:4\tThey have not been hidden from their children, in another generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and his wonders which he hath done. Psalm 78:5\tAnd he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel. How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children: Psalm 78:6\tthat another generation might know them. The children that should be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children. Psalm 78:7\tThat they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: and may seek his commandments. Psalm 78:8\tThat they may not become like their fathers, a perverse end exasperating generation. A generation that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not faithful to God. Psalm 78:9\tThe sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have turned back in the day of battle. Psalm 78:10\tThey kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not walk. Psalm 78:11\tAnd they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had shewn them. Psalm 78:12\tWonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis. Psalm 78:13\tHe divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel. Psalm 78:14\tAnd he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with a light of Psalm 78:15\tHe struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep. Psalm 78:16\tHe brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down as rivers. Psalm 78:17\tAnd they added yet more sin against him: they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water. Psalm 78:18\tAnd they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their desires. Psalm 78:19\tAnd they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? Psalm 78:20\tBecause he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his people? Psalm 78:21\tTherefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel. Psalm 78:22\tBecause they believed not in God: and trusted not in his salvation. Psalm 78:23\tAnd he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of heaven. Psalm 78:24\tAnd had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the bread of heaven. Psalm 78:25\tMan ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in abundance. Psalm 78:26\tHe removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought in the southwest wind. Psalm 78:27\tAnd he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea. Psalm 78:28\tAnd they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions. Psalm 78:29\tSo they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: Psalm 78:30\tthey were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their meat was in their mouth: Psalm 78:31\tand the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel. Psalm 78:32\tIn all these things they sinned still: and they believed not for his wondrous works. Psalm 78:33\tAnd their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste. Psalm 78:34\tWhen he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and came to him early in the morning. Psalm 78:35\tAnd they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high God their redeemer. Psalm 78:36\tAnd they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him: Psalm 78:37\tBut their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted faithful in his covenant. Psalm 78:38\tBut he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not kindle all his wrath. Psalm 78:39\tAnd he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and returneth not. Psalm 78:40\tHow often did they provoke him in the desert: and move him to wrath in the place without water? Psalm 78:41\tAnd they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of Israel. Psalm 78:42\tThey remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them: Psalm 78:43\tHow he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanis. Psalm 78:44\tAnd he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might, not drink. Psalm 78:45\tHe sent amongst them divers sores of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them. Psalm 78:46\tAnd he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust. Psalm 78:47\tAnd he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost. Psalm 78:48\tAnd he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire. Psalm 78:49\tAnd he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels. Psalm 78:50\tHe made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death. Psalm 78:51\tAnd he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham. Psalm 78:52\tAnd he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. Psalm 78:53\tAnd he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: and the sea overwhelmed their enemies. Psalm 78:54\tAnd he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution. Psalm 78:55\tAnd he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles. Psalm 78:56\tYet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept not his testimonies. Psalm 78:57\tAnd they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow. Psalm 78:58\tThey provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to jealousy with their graven things. Psalm 78:59\tGod heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing. Psalm 78:60\tAnd he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he dwelt among men. Psalm 78:61\tAnd he delivered their strength into captivity: and their beauty into the hands of the enemy. Psalm 78:62\tAnd he shut up his people under the sword: and he despised his inheritance. Psalm 78:63\tFire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not lamented. Psalm 78:64\tTheir priests fell by the sword: and their widows did not mourn. Psalm 78:65\tAnd the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine. Psalm 78:66\tAnd he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an everlasting reproach. Psalm 78:67\tAnd he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: Psalm 78:68\tBut he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved. Psalm 78:69\tAnd he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he founded for ever. Psalm 78:70\tAnd he chose his servant David, and took him from the hocks of sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with young, Psalm 78:71\tTo feed Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance. Psalm 78:72\tAnd he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands. Psalm 79:1\tA psalm for Asaph. O God, the heathens are come into thy inheritance, they have defiled thy holy temple: they have made Jerusalem as a place to keep fruit. Psalm 79:2\tThey have given the dead bodies of thy servants to be meat for the fowls of the air: the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth. Psalm 79:3\tThey have poured out their blood as water, round about Jerusalem and there was none to bury them. Psalm 79:4\tWe are become a reproach to our neighbours: a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. Psalm 79:5\tHow long, O Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever: shall thy zeal be kindled like a fire? Psalm 79:6\tPour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee: and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. Psalm 79:7\tBecause they have devoured Jacob; and have laid waste his place. Psalm 79:8\tRemember not our former iniquities: let thy mercies speedily prevent us, for we are become exceeding poor. Psalm 79:9\tHelp us, O God, our saviour: and for the glory of thy name, O Lord, deliver us: and forgive us our sins for thy name’s sake: Psalm 79:10\tLest they should say among the Gentiles: Where is their God? And let him be made known among the nations before our eyes, By the revenging the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed: Psalm 79:11\tlet the sighing of the prisoners come in before thee. According to the greatness of thy arm, take possession of the children of them that have been put to death. Psalm 79:12\tAnd render to our neighbours sevenfold in their bosom: the reproach wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. Psalm 79:13\tBut we thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture, will give thanks to thee for ever. We will shew forth thy praise, unto generation and generation. Psalm 80:1\tUnto the end, for them that shall he changed, a testimony for Asaph, a psalm. Give ear, O thou that rulest Israel: thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep. Thou that sittest upon the cherubims, shine forth Psalm 80:2\tbefore Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses. Stir up thy might, and come to save us. Psalm 80:3\tConvert us, O God: and shew us thy face, and we shall be saved. Psalm 80:4\tO Lord God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy servant? Psalm 80:5\tHow long wilt thou feed us with the bread of tears: and give us for our drink tears in measure? Psalm 80:6\tThou hast made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours: and our enemies have scoffed at us. Psalm 80:7\tO God of hosts, convert us: and shew thy face, and we shall be saved. Psalm 80:8\tThou hast brought a vineyard out of Egypt: thou hast cast cut the Gentiles and planted it. Psalm 80:9\tThou wast the guide of its journey in its sight: thou plantedst the roots thereof, and it filled the land. Psalm 80:10\tThe shadow of it covered the hills: and the branches thereof the cedars of God. Psalm 80:11\tIt stretched forth its branches unto the sea, and its boughs unto the river. Psalm 80:12\tWhy hast thou broken down the hedge thereof, so that all they who pass by the way do pluck it? Psalm 80:13\tThe boar out of the wood hath laid it waste: and a singular wild beast hath devoured it. Psalm 80:14\tTurn again, O God of hosts, look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vineyard: Psalm 80:15\tAnd perfect the same which thy right hand hath planted: and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself. Psalm 80:16\tThings set on fire and dug down shall perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. Psalm 80:17\tLet thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself. Psalm 80:18\tAnd we depart not from thee, thou shalt quicken us: and we will call upon thy name. Psalm 80:19\tO Lord God of hosts, convert us: and shew thy face, and we shall be saved. Psalm 81:1\tUnto the end, for the winepresses, a psalm for Asaph himself. Rejoice to God our helper: sing aloud to the God of Jacob. Psalm 81:2\tTake a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel: the pleasant psaltery with the harp. Psalm 81:3\tBlow up the trumpet on the new moon, on the noted day of your solemnity. Psalm 81:4\tFor it is a commandment in Israel, and a judgment to the God of Jacob. Psalm 81:5\tHe ordained it for a testimony in Joseph, when he came out of the land of Egypt: he heard a tongue which he knew not. Psalm 81:6\tHe removed his back from the burdens: his hands had served in baskets. Psalm 81:7\tThou calledst upon me in affliction, and I delivered thee: I heard thee in the secret place of tempest: I proved thee at the waters of contradiction. Psalm 81:8\tHear, O my people, and I will testify to thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken to me, Psalm 81:9\tthere shall be no new god in thee: neither shalt thou adore a strange god. Psalm 81:10\tFor I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. Psalm 81:11\tBut my people heard not my voice: and Israel hearkened not to me. Psalm 81:12\tSo I let them go according to the desires of their heart: they shall walk in their own inventions. Psalm 81:13\tIf my people had heard me: if Israel had walked in my ways: Psalm 81:14\tI should soon have humbled their enemies, and laid my hand on them that troubled them. Psalm 81:15\tThe enemies of the Lord have lied to him: and their time shall be for ever. Psalm 81:16\tAnd he fed them with the fat of wheat, and filled them with honey out of the rock. Psalm 82:1\tA psalm for Asaph. God hath stood in the congregation of gods: and being in the midst of them he judgeth gods. Psalm 82:2\tHow long will you judge unjustly: and accept the persons of the wicked? Psalm 82:3\tJudge for the needy and fatherless: do justice to the humble and the poor. Psalm 82:4\tRescue the poor; and deliver the needy out of the hand of the sinner. Psalm 82:5\tThey have not known nor understood: they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth shall be moved. Psalm 82:6\tI have said: You are gods and all of you the sons of the most High. Psalm 82:7\tBut you like men shall die: and shall fall like one of the princes. Psalm 82:8\tArise, O God, judge thou the earth: for thou shalt inherit among all the nations. Psalm 83:1\tA canticle of a psalm for Asaph. O God, who shall be like to thee? hold not thy peace, neither be thou still, O God. Psalm 83:2\tFor lo, thy enemies have made a noise: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. Psalm 83:3\tThey have taken a malicious counsel against thy people, and have consulted against thy saints. Psalm 83:4\tThey have said: Come and let us destroy them, so that they be not a nation: and let the name of Israel be remembered no more. Psalm 83:5\tFor they have contrived with one consent: they have made a covenant together against thee, Psalm 83:6\tthe tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismahelites: Moab, and the Agarens, Psalm 83:7\tGebal, and Ammon and Amalec: the Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre. Psalm 83:8\tYea, and the Assyrian also is joined with them: they are come to the aid of the sons of Lot. Psalm 83:9\tDo to them as thou didst to Madian and to Sisara: as to Jabin at the brook of Cisson. Psalm 83:10\tWho perished at Endor: and became as dung for the earth. Psalm 83:11\tMake their princes like Oreb, and Zeb, and Zebee, and Salmana. All their princes, Psalm 83:12\twho have said: Let us possess the sanctuary of God for an inheritance. Psalm 83:13\tO my God, make them like a wheel; and as stubble before the wind. Psalm 83:14\tAs fire which burneth the wood: and as a flame burning mountains: Psalm 83:15\tSo shalt thou pursue them with thy tempest: and shalt trouble them in thy wrath. Psalm 83:16\tFill their faces with shame; and they shall seek thy name, O Lord. Psalm 83:17\tLet them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever: and let them be confounded and perish. Psalm 83:18\tAnd let them know that the Lord is thy name: thou alone art the most High over all the earth. Psalm 84:1\tUnto the end, for the winepresses, a psalm for the sons of Core. How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of host! Psalm 84:2\tmy soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God. Psalm 84:3\tFor the sparrow hath found herself a house, and the turtle a nest for herself where she may lay her young ones: Thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my king and my God. Psalm 84:4\tBlessed are they that dwell in thy house, O Lord: they shall praise thee for ever and ever. Psalm 84:5\tBlessed is the man whose help is from thee: in his heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps, Psalm 84:6\tin the vale of tears, in the place which be hath set. Psalm 84:7\tFor the lawgiver shall give a blessing, they shall go from virtue to virtue: the God of gods shall be seen in Sion. Psalm 84:8\tO Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Psalm 84:9\tBehold, O God our protector: and look on the face of thy Christ. Psalm 84:10\tFor better is one day in thy courts above thousands. I have chosen to be an abject in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tabernacles of sinners. Psalm 84:11\tFor God loveth mercy and truth: the Lord will give grace and glory. Psalm 84:12\tHe will not deprive of good things them that walk in innocence : O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee. Psalm 85:1\tUnto the end, for the sons of Core, a psalm. Lord, thou hast blessed thy land: thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob. Psalm 85:2\tThou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: thou hast covered all their sins. Psalm 85:3\tThou hast mitigated all thy anger: thou best turned away from the wrath of thy indignation. Psalm 85:4\tConvert us, O God our saviour: and turn off thy anger from us. Psalm 85:5\tWilt thou be angry with us for ever: or wilt thou extend thy wrath from generation to generation? Psalm 85:6\tThou wilt turn, O God, and bring us to life: and thy people shall rejoice in thee. Psalm 85:7\tShew us, O Lord, thy mercy; and grant us thy salvation. Psalm 85:8\tI will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: for he will speak peace unto his people: And unto his saints: and unto them that are converted to the heart. Psalm 85:9\tSurely his salvation is near to them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land. Psalm 85:10\tMercy and truth have met each other: justice and peace have kissed. Psalm 85:11\tTruth is sprung out of the earth: and justice hath looked down from heaven. Psalm 85:12\tFor the Lord will give goodness: and our earth shall yield her fruit. Psalm 85:13\tJustice shall walk before him: and shall set his steps in the way. Psalm 86:1\tA prayer for David himself. Incline thy ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am needy and poor. Psalm 86:2\tPreserve my soul, for I am holy: save thy servant, O my God, that trusteth in thee. Psalm 86:3\tHave mercy on me, O Lord, for I have cried to thee all the day. Psalm 86:4\tGive joy to the soul of thy servant, for to thee, O Lord, I have lifted up my soul. Psalm 86:5\tFor thou, O Lord, art sweet and mild: and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee. Psalm 86:6\tGive ear, O Lord, to my prayer: and attend to the voice of my petition. Psalm 86:7\tI have called upon thee in the day of my trouble: because thou hast heard me. Psalm 86:8\tThere is none among the gods like unto thee, O Lord: and there is none according to thy works. Psalm 86:9\tAll the nations thou hast made shall come and adore before thee, O Lord: and they shall glorify thy name. Psalm 86:10\tFor thou art great and dost wonderful things: thou art God alone. Psalm 86:11\tConduct me, O Lord, in thy way, and I will walk in thy truth: let my heart rejoice that it may fear thy name. Psalm 86:12\tI will praise thee, O Lord my God: with my whole heart, and I will glorify thy name for ever: Psalm 86:13\tFor thy mercy is great towards me: and thou hast delivered my soul out of the lower hell. Psalm 86:14\tO God, the wicked are risen up against me, and the assembly of the mighty have sought my soul: and they have not set thee before their eyes. Psalm 86:15\tAnd thou, O Lord, art a God of compassion, and merciful, patient, and of much mercy, and true. Psalm 86:16\tO look upon me, and have mercy on me: give thy command to thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid. Psalm 86:17\tShew me a token for good: that they who hate me may see, and be confounded, because thou, O Lord, hast helped me and hast comforted me. Psalm 87:1\tFor the sons of Core, a psalm of a canticle. The foundations thereof are in the holy mountains: Psalm 87:2\tThe Lord loveth the gates of Sion above all the tabernacles of Jacob. Psalm 87:3\tGlorious things are said of thee, O city of God. Psalm 87:4\tI will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon knowing me. Behold the foreigners, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians, these were there. Psalm 87:5\tShall not Sion say: This man and that man is born in her? and the Highest himself hath founded her. Psalm 87:6\tThe Lord shall tell in his writings of peoples and of princes, of them that have been in her. Psalm 87:7\tThe dwelling in thee is as it were of all rejoicing. Psalm 88:1\tA canticle of a psalm for the sons of Core: unto the end, for Maheleth, to answer understanding of Eman the Ezrahite. O Lord, the God of my salvation: I have cried in the day, and in the night before thee. Psalm 88:2\tLet my prayer come in before thee: incline thy ear to my petition. Psalm 88:3\tFor my soul is filled with evils: and my life hath drawn nigh to hell. Psalm 88:4\tI am counted among them that go down to the pit: I am become as a man without help, Psalm 88:5\tfree among the dead. Like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cast off from thy hand. Psalm 88:6\tThey have laid me in the lower pit: in the dark places, and in the shadow of death. Psalm 88:7\tThy wrath is strong over me: and all thy waves thou hast brought in upon me. Psalm 88:8\tThou hast put away my acquaintance far from me: they have set me an abomination to themselves. I was delivered up, and came not forth: Psalm 88:9\tmy eyes languished through poverty. All the day I cried to thee, O Lord: I stretched out my hands to thee. Psalm 88:10\tWilt thou shew wonders to the dead? or shall physicians raise to life, and give praise to thee? Psalm 88:11\tShall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy: and thy truth in destruction? Psalm 88:12\tShall thy wonders be known in the dark; and thy justice in the land of forgetfulness? Psalm 88:13\tBut I, O Lord, have cried to thee: and in the morning my prayer shall prevent thee. Psalm 88:14\tLord, why castest thou off my prayer: why turnest thou away thy face from me? Psalm 88:15\tI am poor, and in labours from my youth: and being exalted have been humbled and troubled. Psalm 88:16\tThy wrath hath come upon me: and thy terrors have troubled me. Psalm 88:17\tThey have come round about me like water all the day: they have compassed me about together. Psalm 88:18\tFriend and neighbour thou hast put far from me: and my acquaintance, because of misery. Psalm 89:1\tOf understanding, for Ethan the Ezrahite. The mercies of the Lord I will sing for ever. I will shew forth thy truth with my mouth to generation and generation. Psalm 89:2\tFor thou hast said: Mercy shall be built up for ever in the heavens: thy truth shall be prepared in them. Psalm 89:3\tI have made a covenant with my elect: I have sworn to David my servant: Psalm 89:4\tThy seed will I settle for ever. And I will build up thy throne unto generation and generation. Psalm 89:5\tThe heavens shall confess thy wonders, O Lord: and thy truth in the church of the saints. Psalm 89:6\tFor who in the clouds can be compared to the Lord: or who among the sons of God shall be like to God? Psalm 89:7\tGod, who is glorified in the assembly of the saints: great and terrible above all them that are about him. Psalm 89:8\tO Lord God of hosts, who is like to thee? thou art mighty, O Lord, and thy truth is round about thee. Psalm 89:9\tThou rulest the power of the sea: and appeasest the motion of the waves thereof. Psalm 89:10\tThou hast humbled the proud one, as one that is slain: with the arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies. Psalm 89:11\tThine are the heavens, and thine is the earth: the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded: Psalm 89:12\tthe north and the sea thou hast created. Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name: Psalm 89:13\tthy arm is with might. Let thy hand be strengthened, and thy right hand exalted: Psalm 89:14\tjustice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne. Mercy and truth shall go before thy face: Psalm 89:15\tblessed is the people that knoweth jubilation. They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance: Psalm 89:16\tand in thy name they shall rejoice all the day, and in thy justice they shall be exalted. Psalm 89:17\tFor thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy good pleasure shall our horn be exalted. Psalm 89:18\tFor our protection is of the Lord, and of our king the holy one of Israel. Psalm 89:19\tThen thou spokest in a vision to thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of my people. Psalm 89:20\tI have found David my servant: with my holy oil I have anointed him. Psalm 89:21\tFor my hand shall help him: and my arm shall strengthen him. Psalm 89:22\tThe enemy shall have no advantage over him: nor the son of iniquity have power to hurt him. Psalm 89:23\tAnd I will cut down his enemies before his face; and them that hate him I will put to flight. Psalm 89:24\tAnd my truth and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted. Psalm 89:25\tAnd I will set his hand in the sea; and his right hand in the rivers. Psalm 89:26\tHe shall cry out to me: Thou art my father: my God, and the support of my salvation. Psalm 89:27\tAnd I will make him my firstborn, high above the kings of the earth. Psalm 89:28\tI will keep my mercy for him for ever: and my covenant faithful to him. Psalm 89:29\tAnd I will make his seed to endure for evermore: and his throne as the days of heaven. Psalm 89:30\tAnd if his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments: Psalm 89:31\tIf they profane my justices: and keep not my commandments: Psalm 89:32\tI will visit their iniquities with a rod: and their sins with stripes. Psalm 89:33\tBut my mercy I will not take away from him: nor will I suffer my truth to fail. Psalm 89:34\tNeither will I profane my covenant: and the words that proceed from my mouth I will not make void.

Psalm 105:18\tThey humbled his feet in fetters: the iron pierced his soul, Psalm 105:19\tuntil his word came. The word of the Lord inflamed him. Psalm 105:20\tThe king sent, and he released him: the ruler of the people, and he set him at liberty. Psalm 105:21\tHe made him master of his house, and ruler of all his possession. Psalm 105:22\tThat he might instruct his princes as himself, and teach his ancients wisdom. Psalm 105:23\tAnd Israel went into Egypt: and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Cham. Psalm 105:24\tAnd he increased his people exceedingly: and strengthened them over their enemies, Psalm 105:25\tHe turned their heart to hate his people: and to deal deceitfully with his servants. Psalm 105:26\tHe sent Moses his servant: Aaron the man whom he had chosen. Psalm 105:27\tHe gave them power to shew his signs, and his wonders in the land of Cham. Psalm 105:28\tHe sent darkness, and made it obscure: and grieved not his words. Psalm 105:29\tHe turned their waters into blood, and destroyed their fish. Psalm 105:30\tTheir land brought forth frogs, in the inner chambers of their kings. Psalm 105:31\tHe spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies and sciniphs in all their coasts. Psalm 105:32\tHe gave them hail for rain, a burning fire in the land. Psalm 105:33\tAnd he destroyed their vineyards and their fig trees: and he broke in pieces the trees of their coasts. Psalm 105:34\tHe spoke, and the locust came, and the bruchus, of which there was no number. Psalm 105:35\tAnd they devoured all the grass in their land, and consumed all the fruit of their ground. Psalm 105:36\tAnd he slew all the firstborn in their land: the firstfruits of all their labour. Psalm 105:37\tAnd he brought them out with silver and gold: and there was not among their tribes one that was feeble. Psalm 105:38\tEgypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them lay upon them. Psalm 105:39\tHe spread a cloud for their protection, and fire to give them light in the night. Psalm 105:40\tThey asked, and the quail came: and he filled them with the bread of heaven. Psalm 105:41\tHe opened the rock, and waters flowed: rivers ran down in the dry land. Psalm 105:42\tBecause he remembered his holy word, which he had spoken to his servant Abraham. Psalm 105:43\tAnd he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness. Psalm 105:44\tAnd he gave them the lands of the Gentiles: and they possessed the labours of the people: Psalm 105:45\tThat they might observe his justifications, and seek after his law. Psalm 106:1\tAlleluia. Give glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. Psalm 106:2\tWho shall declare the powers of the Lord? who shall set forth all his praises? Psalm 106:3\tBlessed are they that keep judgment, and do justice at all times. Psalm 106:4\tRemember us, O Lord, in the favour of thy people: visit us with thy salvation. Psalm 106:5\tThat we may see the good of thy chosen, that we may rejoice in the joy of thy nation: that thou mayst be praised with thy inheritance. Psalm 106:6\tWe have sinned with our fathers: we have acted unjustly, we have wrought iniquity. Psalm 106:7\tOur fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt: they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies: And they provoked to wrath going up to the sea, even the Red Sea. Psalm 106:8\tAnd he saved them for his own name’s sake: that he might make his power known. Psalm 106:9\tAnd he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up: and he led them through the depths, as in a wilderness. Psalm 106:10\tAnd he saved them from the hand of them that hated them: and he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. Psalm 106:11\tAnd the water covered them that afflicted them: there was not one of them left. Psalm 106:12\tAnd they believed his words: and they sang his praises. Psalm 106:13\tThey had quickly done, they forgot his works: and they waited not for his counsels. Psalm 106:14\tAnd they coveted their desire in the desert: and they tempted God in the place without water. Psalm 106:15\tAnd he gave them their request: and sent fulness into their souls. Psalm 106:16\tAnd they provoked Moses in the camp, Aaron the holy one of the Lord. Psalm 106:17\tThe earth opened and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of Abiron. Psalm 106:18\tAnd a fire was kindled in their congregation: the flame burned the wicked. Psalm 106:19\tThey made also a calf in Horeb: and they adored the graven thing. Psalm 106:20\tAnd they changed their glory into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass. Psalm 106:21\tThey forgot God, who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt, Psalm 106:22\twondrous works in the land of Cham: terrible things in the Red Sea. Psalm 106:23\tAnd he said that he would destroy them: had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach: To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. Psalm 106:24\tAnd they set at nought the desirable land. They believed not his word, Psalm 106:25\tand they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord. Psalm 106:26\tAnd he lifted up his hand over them: to overthrow them in the desert; Psalm 106:27\tAnd to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the countries. Psalm 106:28\tThey also were initiated to Beelphegor: and ate the sacrifices of the dead. Psalm 106:29\tAnd they provoked him with their inventions: and destruction was multiplied among them. Psalm 106:30\tThen Phinees stood up, and pacified him: and the slaughter ceased. Psalm 106:31\tAnd it was reputed to him unto justice, to generation and generation for evermore. Psalm 106:32\tThey provoked him also at the waters of contradiction: and Moses was afflicted for their sakes: Psalm 106:33\tbecause they exasperated his spirit. And he distinguished with his lips. Psalm 106:34\tThey did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto them. Psalm 106:35\tAnd they were mingled among the heathens, and learned their works: Psalm 106:36\tand served their idols, and it became a stumblingblock to them. Psalm 106:37\tAnd they sacrificed their sons, and their daughters to devils. Psalm 106:38\tAnd they shed innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan. And the land was polluted with blood, Psalm 106:39\tand was defiled with their works: and they went aside after their own inventions. Psalm 106:40\tAnd the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: and he abhorred his inheritance. Psalm 106:41\tAnd he delivered them into the hands of the nations: and they that hated them had dominion over them. Psalm 106:42\tAnd their enemies afflicted them: and they were humbled under their hands: Psalm 106:43\tmany times did he deliver them. But they provoked him with their counsel: and they were brought low by their iniquities. Psalm 106:44\tAnd he saw when they were in tribulation: and he heard their prayer. Psalm 106:45\tAnd he was mindful of his covenant: and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. Psalm 106:46\tAnd he gave them unto mercies, in the sight of all those that had made them captives. Psalm 106:47\tSave us, O Lord, our God: and gather us from among nations: That we may give thanks to thy holy name, and may glory in thy praise. Psalm 106:48\tBlessed be the Lord the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say: So be it, so be it. Psalm 107:1\tGive glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. Psalm 107:2\tLet them say so that have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy: and gathered out of the countries. Psalm 107:3\tFrom the rising and the setting of the sun, from the north and from the sea. Psalm 107:4\tThey wandered in a wilderness, in a place without water: they found not the way of a city for their habitation. Psalm 107:5\tThey were hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them. Psalm 107:6\tAnd they cried to the Lord in their tribulation: and he delivered them out of their distresses. Psalm 107:7\tAnd he led them into the right way: that they might go to a city of habitation. Psalm 107:8\tLet the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful works to the children of men. Psalm 107:9\tFor he hath satisfied the empty soul, and hath filled the hungry soul with good things. Psalm 107:10\tSuch as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death: bound in want and in iron. Psalm 107:11\tBecause they had exasperated the words of God: and provoked the counsel of the most High: Psalm 107:12\tAnd their heart was humbled with labours: they were weakened, and their was none to help them. Psalm 107:13\tThen they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he delivered them out of their distresses. Psalm 107:14\tAnd he brought them out of darkness, and the shadow of death; and broke their bonds in sunder. Psalm 107:15\tLet the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men. Psalm 107:16\tBecause he hath broken gates of brass, and burst the iron bars. Psalm 107:17\tHe took them out of the way of their iniquity: for they were brought low for their injustices. Psalm 107:18\tTheir soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they drew nigh even to the gates of death. Psalm 107:19\tAnd they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he delivered them out of their distresses. Psalm 107:20\tHe sent his word, and healed them: and delivered them from their destructions. Psalm 107:21\tLet the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful works to the children of men. Psalm 107:22\tAnd let them sacrifice the sacrifice of praise: and declare his works with joy. Psalm 107:23\tThey that go down to the sea in ships, doing business in the great waters: Psalm 107:24\tThese have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. Psalm 107:25\tHe said the word, and there arose a storm of wind: and the waves thereof were lifted up. Psalm 107:26\tThey mount up to the heavens, and they go down to the depths: their soul pined away with evils. Psalm 107:27\tThey were troubled, and reeled like a drunken man; and all their wisdom was swallowed up. Psalm 107:28\tAnd they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he brought them out of their distresses. Psalm 107:29\tAnd he turned the storm into a breeze: and its waves were still. Psalm 107:30\tAnd they rejoiced because they were still: and he brought them to the haven which they wished for. Psalm 107:31\tLet the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men. Psalm 107:32\tAnd let them exalt him in the church of the people: and praise him in the chair of the ancients. Psalm 107:33\tHe hath turned rivers into a wilderness: and the sources of water into dry ground: Psalm 107:34\tA fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. Psalm 107:35\tHe hath turned a wilderness into pools of water, and a dry land into water springs. Psalm 107:36\tAnd hath placed there the hungry; and they made a city for their habitation. Psalm 107:37\tAnd they sowed fields, and planted vineyards: and they yielded fruit of birth. Psalm 107:38\tAnd he blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly: and their cattle he suffered not to decrease. Psalm 107:39\tThen they were brought to be few: and they were afflicted through the trouble of evils and sorrow. Psalm 107:40\tContempt was poured forth upon their princes: and he caused them to wander where there was no passing, and out of the way. Psalm 107:41\tAnd he helped the poor out of poverty: and made him families like a flock of sheep. Psalm 107:42\tThe just shall see, and shall rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop their mouth. Psalm 107:43\tWho is wise, and will keep these things: and will understand the mercies of the Lord? Psalm 108:1\tA canticle of a psalm for David himself. My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will sing, and will give praise, with my glory. Psalm 108:2\tArise, my glory; arise, psaltery and harp: I will arise in the morning early. Psalm 108:3\tI will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: and I will sing unto thee among the populations. Psalm 108:4\tFor thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth even unto the clouds. Psalm 108:5\tBe thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory over all the earth: Psalm 108:6\tthat thy beloved may be delivered. Save with thy right hand and hear me. Psalm 108:7\tGod hath spoken in his holiness. I will rejoice, and I will divide Sichem and I will mete out the vale of tabernacles. Psalm 108:8\tGalaad is mine, and Manasses is mine and Ephraim the protection of my head. Juda is my king: Psalm 108:9\tMoab the pot of my hope. Over Edom I will stretch out my shoe: the aliens are become my friends. Psalm 108:10\tWho will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? Psalm 108:11\tWilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our armies? Psalm 108:12\tO grant us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. Psalm 108:13\tThrough God we shall do mightily: and he will bring our enemies to nothing. Psalm 109:1\tUnto the end, a psalm for David. Psalm 109:2\tO God, be not thou silent in thy praise: for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me. Psalm 109:3\tThey have spoken against with deceitful tongues; and they have compassed me about with words of hatred; and have fought against me without cause. Psalm 109:4\tInstead of making me a return of love, they detracted me: but I gave myself to prayer. Psalm 109:5\tAnd they repaid me evil for good: and hatred for my love. Psalm 109:6\tSet thou the sinner over him: and may the devil stand at his right hand. Psalm 109:7\tWhen he is judged, may he go out condemned; and may his prayer be turned to sin. Psalm 109:8\tMay his days be few: and his bishopric let another take. Psalm 109:9\tMay his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. Psalm 109:10\tLet his children be carried about vagabonds, and beg; and let them be cast out of their dwellings. Psalm 109:11\tMay the userer search all his substance: and let strangers plunder his labours. Psalm 109:12\tMay there be none to help him: nor none to pity his fatherless offspring. Psalm 109:13\tMay his posterity be cut off; in one generation may his name be blotted out. Psalm 109:14\tMay the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the sight of the Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. Psalm 109:15\tMay they be before the lord continually, and let the memory of them perish from the earth: Psalm 109:16\tbecause he remembered not to show mercy, Psalm 109:17\tBut persecuted the poor man and the beggar; and the broken in heart, to put him to death. Psalm 109:18\tAnd he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him: and he would not have blessing, and it shall be far from him. And he put on cursing, like a garment: and it went in like water into his entrails, and like oil in his bones. Psalm 109:19\tMay it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; and like a girdle with which he is girded continually. Psalm 109:20\tThis is the work of them who detract me before the Lord; and who speak evils against my soul. Psalm 109:21\tBut thou, O Lord, do with for thy names sake: because thy mercy is sweet. Do thou deliver me. Psalm 109:22\tfor I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me. Psalm 109:23\tI am taken away like the shadow when it declineth: and I am shaken off as locusts. Psalm 109:24\tMy knees are weakened through fasting: and my flesh is changed for oil. Psalm 109:25\tAnd I am become a reproach to them: they saw me and they shaked their heads, Psalm 109:26\tHelp me, O Lord my God; save me according to thy mercy. Psalm 109:27\tAnd let them know that this is thy hand: and that thou, O Lord, hast done it. Psalm 109:28\tThey will curse and thou will bless: let them that rise up against me be confounded: but thy servant shall rejoice. Psalm 109:29\tLet them that detract me be clothed with shame: and let them be covered with the their confusion as with a double cloak. Psalm 109:30\tI will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth: and in the midst of many I will praise him. Psalm 109:31\tBecause he hath stood at the right hand of the poor, to save my soul from persecutors Psalm 110:1\tThe Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou at my right hand: Until I make thy enemies thy footstool. Psalm 110:2\tThe Lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion: rule thou in the midst of thy enemies. Psalm 110:3\tWith thee is the principality in the day of thy strength: in the brightness of the saints: from the womb before the day star I begot thee. Psalm 110:4\tThe Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech. Psalm 110:5\tThe Lord at thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his wrath. Psalm 110:6\tHe shall judge among nations, he shall fill ruins: he shall crush the heads in the land of the many. Psalm 110:7\tHe shall drink of the torrent in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head. Psalm 111:1\tI will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; in the council of the just: and in the congregation. Psalm 111:2\tGreat are the works of the Lord: sought out according to all his wills Psalm 111:3\tHis work is praise and magnificence: and his justice continueth for ever and ever. Psalm 111:4\tHe hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord: Psalm 111:5\the hath given food to them that fear him. He will be mindful for ever of his covenant: Psalm 111:6\the will shew forth to his people the power of his works. Psalm 111:7\tThat he may give them the inheritance of the Gentiles: the works of his hands are truth and judgment. Psalm 111:8\tAll his commandments are faithful: confirmed for ever and ever, made in truth and equity. Psalm 111:9\tHe hath sent redemption to his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever. Holy and terrible is his name: Psalm 111:10\tthe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. A good understanding to all that do it: his praise continueth for ever and ever. Psalm 112:1\tBlessed is the man that feareth the Lord: he shall delight exceedingly in his commandments. Psalm 112:2\tHis seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed. Psalm 112:3\tGlory and wealth shall be in his house: and his justice remaineth for ever and ever. Psalm 112:4\tTo the righteous a light is risen up in darkness: he is merciful, and compassionate and just. Psalm 112:5\tAcceptable is the man that showeth mercy and lendeth: he shall order his words with judgment: Psalm 112:6\tbecause he shall not be moved for ever. Psalm 112:7\tThe just shall be in everlasting remembrance: he shall not hear the evil hearing. His heart is ready to hope in the Lord: Psalm 112:8\this heart is strengthened, he shall not be moved until he look over his enemies. Psalm 112:9\tHe hath distributed, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever and ever: his horn shall be exalted in glory. Psalm 112:10\tThe wicked shall see, and shall be angry, he shall gnash with his teeth and pine away: the desire of the wicked shall perish. Psalm 113:1\tPraise the Lord, ye children: praise ye the name of the Lord. Psalm 113:2\tBlessed be the name of the Lord, from henceforth now and for ever. Psalm 113:3\tFrom the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the name of the Lord is worthy of praise. Psalm 113:4\tThe Lord is high above all nations; and his glory above the heavens. Psalm 113:5\tWho is as the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high: Psalm 113:6\tand looketh down on the low things in heaven and in earth? Psalm 113:7\tRaising up the needy from the earth, and lifting up the poor out of the dunghill:: Psalm 113:8\tThat he may place him with princes, with the princes of his people. Psalm 113:9\tWho maketh a barren woman to dwell in a house, the joyful mother of children. Psalm 114:1\tWhen Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous people: Psalm 114:2\tJudea made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. Psalm 114:3\tThe sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back. Psalm 114:4\tThe mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like the lambs of the flock. Psalm 114:5\tWhat ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: and thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back? Psalm 114:6\tYe mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye hills, like lambs of the flock? Psalm 114:7\tAt the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, at the presence of the God of Jacob: Psalm 114:8\tWho turned the rock into pools of water, and the stony hill into fountains of waters. Psalm 115:1\tNot to us, O Lord, not to us; but to thy name give glory. Psalm 115:2\tFor thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake: lest the gentiles should say: Where is their God? Psalm 115:3\tBut our God is in heaven: he hath done all things whatsoever he would. Psalm 115:4\tThe idols of the gentiles are silver and gold, the works of the hands of men. Psalm 115:5\tThey have mouths and speak not: they have eyes and see not. Psalm 115:6\tThey have ears and hear not: they have noses and smell not. Psalm 115:7\tThey have hands and feel not: they have feet and walk not: neither shall they cry out through their throat.

Psalm 115:15\tBlessed be you of the Lord, who made heaven and earth. Psalm 115:16\tThe heaven of heaven is the Lord’s: but the earth he has given to the children of men. Psalm 115:17\tThe dead shall not praise thee, O Lord: nor any of them that go down to hell. Psalm 115:18\tBut we that live bless the Lord: from this time now and for ever. Psalm 116:1\tI have loved, because the Lord will hear the voice of my prayer. Psalm 116:2\tBecause he hath inclined his ear unto me: and in my days I will call upon him.

Psalm 116:9\tI will please the Lord in the land of the living. Psalm 116:10\tI have believed, therefore have I spoken; but I have been humbled exceedingly. Psalm 116:11\tI said in my excess: Every man is a liar. Psalm 116:12\tWhat shall I render to the Lord, for all the things he hath rendered unto me? Psalm 116:13\tI will take the chalice of salvation; and I will call upon the name of the Lord. Psalm 116:14\tI will pay my vows to the Lord before all his people: Psalm 116:15\tprecious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. Psalm 116:16\tO Lord, for I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid. Thou hast broken my bonds: Psalm 116:17\tI will sacrifice to thee the sacrifice of praise, and I will call upon the name of the Lord. Psalm 116:18\tI will pay my vows to the Lord in the sight of all his people: Psalm 116:19\tin the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Psalm 117:1\tO praise the Lord, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people. Psalm 117:2\tFor his mercy is confirmed upon us: and the truth of the Lord remaineth for ever. Psalm 118:1\tGive praise to Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. Psalm 118:2\tLet Israel now say that he is good: that his mercy endureth for ever.

Psalm 118:5\tIn my trouble I called upon the Lord: and the Lord heard me, and enlarged me. Psalm 118:6\tThe Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man can do unto me. Psalm 118:7\tThe Lord is my helper: and I will look over my enemies. Psalm 118:8\tIt is good to confide in the Lord, rather than to have confidence in man. Psalm 118:9\tIt is good to trust in the Lord, rather than to trust in princes. Psalm 118:10\tAll nations compassed me about; and in the name of the Lord I have been revenged on them. Psalm 118:11\tSurrounding me they compassed me about: and in the name of the Lord I have been revenged on them. Psalm 118:12\tThey surrounded me like bees, and they burned like fire among thorns: and in the name of the Lord I was revenged on them Psalm 118:13\tBeing pushed I was overturned that I might fall: but the Lord supported me. Psalm 118:14\tThe Lord is my strength and my praise: and he is become my salvation. Psalm 118:15\tThe voice of rejoicing and of salvation is in the tabernacles of the just. Psalm 118:16\tThe right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength: the right hand of the Lord hath exulted me: the right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength. Psalm 118:17\tI shall not die, but live: and shall declare the works of the Lord. Psalm 118:18\tThe Lord chastising hath chastised me: but he hath not delivered me over to death. Psalm 118:19\tOpen ye to me the gates of justice: I will go into them, and give praise to the Lord. Psalm 118:20\tThis is the gate of the Lord, the just shall enter into it.

Psalm 131:3\tLet Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth now and for ever. Psalm 132:1\tO Lord, remember David, and all his meekness. Psalm 132:2\tHow he swore to the Lord, he vowed a vow to the God of Jacob: Psalm 132:3\tIf I shall enter into the tabernacle of my house: if I shall go up into the bed wherein I lie: Psalm 132:4\tIf I shall give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids, Psalm 132:5\tOr rest to my temples: until I find out a place for the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. Psalm 132:6\tBehold we have heard of it in Ephrata: we have found it in the fields of the wood. Psalm 132:7\tWe will go into his tabernacle: We will adore in the place where his feet stood.
